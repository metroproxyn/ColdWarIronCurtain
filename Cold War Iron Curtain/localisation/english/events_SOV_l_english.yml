 soviet_leader_change.1.d.A:0 "Terrible news, comrades. Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin has died at the age of 74 in Kuntsevo Dacha after suffering a stroke. Days before his stroke, Stalin and a small number of his inner circle, consisting of Malenkov, Molotov, Beria, and Khrushchev and a few others gathered together for an evening of entertainment and imbibing alcoholic beverages. The guests dispersed at approximately 4:00 a.m. the next day and Stalin retired to his private quarters with strict instructions that he was not to be disturbed until sounds were heard indicating that he had awakened. Time passed and no sounds were heard throughout the day. At approximately 11:00 p.m. on the same day his housekeeper cautiously entered his room and found him lying on the floor, wearing his pajama trousers and a shirt. He was unconscious, breathing heavily, incontinent, and unresponsive to attempts to rouse him. Beria was called and, upon seeing him, discounted the fact that he was unconscious, attributing this to alcohol consumption, and departed.\nAt 7:00 a.m. on the next day, Beria and a group of medical experts were summoned to examine him. Based on their examination, which revealed a blood pressure of 190/110 and a right-sided hemiplegia, they concluded that Stalin, who had a known history of uncontrolled hypertension, had sustained a hemorrhagic stroke involving the left middle cerebral artery. Over the next two days he received a variety of treatments; and, in an attempt to decrease his blood pressure, which had risen to 210/120, two separate applications of eight leeches each were applied to his neck and face over the next two days. However, his condition continued to deteriorate and he died at [GetDateText]. His body then was taken to an unspecified location and an autopsy was performed, after which it was embalmed for public viewing. Nikita Khrushchev, Georgy Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov and Lavrentiy Beria are in charge of organizing the funeral."

Days before his stroke, Stalin and a small number of his inner circle, consisting of Malenkov, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov and a few others gathered together for an evening of entertainment and imbibing alcoholic beverages. The guests dispersed at approximately 4:00 a.m. the next day and Stalin retired to his private quarters with strict instructions that he was not to be disturbed until sounds were heard indicating that he had awakened.

Thanks to the doctors quick responses, which revealed a blood pressure of 190/110 and a right-sided hemiplegia, Comrade Stalin, who had a known history of uncontrolled hypertension, had partially recovered from the stroke. Over the next few weeks he received a variety of treatments; and, announced he planned to retire at the next Party congress, but in the meantime he will establish a rotating advisory body made of his members of his politiburo to help him in his task. Maksim Saburov, Georgy Malenkov and Mikhail Pervukhin are the first members of this council."

 Swf_Later_Stalin.1.d:0 "For more than a century, there have been discussions on reversing the flow of rivers that flow uselessly to the arctic. This would harness immense power and create an agricultural revolution across once desolate spaces. In the 1930s, top Soviet scientists at the Academy of Sciences discussed the issue of reversing the river, but on a more manageable scale. The state wishes to begin this process, with the hopes of providing Soviet workers and peasants greater water security and prosperity."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.2.d:0 "The Politburo has directed relevant agencies to begin preparations for population transfers in Soviet Central Asia. The movements of populations, especially in recent years, has raised the issue of potential future ethnic conflicts in these areas. Restoring ethnic homogeny will only strengthen those Soviet Socialist Republics. In addition, there are minority populations which can be shifted to areas where they form a majority. These operations require security branches to work closely with other relevant state agencies to ensure a smooth, swift series of operations."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.3.d:0 "There is a robust, though small, Armenian community across Soviet Central Asia. Some arrived as far back as the mid-nineteenth century. There are those who settled even earlier, establishing themselves as traders. However, they are slowly growing into a recognizable minority community in the region, raising tensions as locals are said to be resentful over their economic status and alien culture. To prevent potential problems and to prevent ethnic tensions, the state has approved plans to transfer Armenians in Central Asia to the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. This operation not only achieves our goals of promoting harmony in Central Asia but also helps unify the Armenian population. Despite these positives, there are reports that Central Asian Armenians are upset and claim to lack any familiarity with life in the Armenian SSR."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.4.d:0 "The first step towards reversing the flow of Soviet rivers away was recently achieved. The Soviet Union officially opened a Pechora-Kama Canal. The project had been discussed intensely during the 1930s but only recently put under construction. The canal will redirect the flow of the Pechora River into the Volga Basin, increasing its flow into the Caspian Sea. For over a century, Russian officials and scientists have sought to develop a Great Northern River Reversal campaign that would finally stop the flow of water into the Arctic Ocean. Despite this early success, the project is expected to take years and cost huge amounts of resources to complete."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.5.d:0 "Reports from East Germany talk about heartbreaking scenes of large groups of Germans being forcibly put on trains headed for Soviet Central Asia. These mass deportations were ordered by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin following a failed anti-Soviet uprising. The Soviet government is expected to send the suspected anti-Soviet activists to northern Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, where Stalin had expelled the Volga Germans at the outbreak of World War II. The mass deportations are being widely condemned in the non-communist world, but the Soviet government remains committed to its policy."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.6.d:0 "The Soviet Union is currently conducting one of the largest population exchanges in its history, across Soviet Central Asia. In an effort to apparently preserve ethnic homogeny and to prevent potential sources of unrest, all major ethnic communities in the region will be moved to their ethnic homeland. Kazakhs in all Soviet Central Asian states will be moved to the Kazakh SSR. All ethnic Uzbeks will be moved to the Uzbek SSR. Soviet officials insist its actions are being welcomed by those moved, who are thankful the state has stepped in to unite them. However, anti-Soviet activists claim the deportations are uprooting communities who have lived for generations across the region and will promote ethnic rivalries between the different states."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.7.d:0 "Ukrainians in Soviet Central Asia have been coming in waves since as early as the eighteenth century. A mix of voluntary and forced settlers moved from the Ukraine up to the Soviet era. Under Soviet rule, during the 1930s and 1940s, the state forcibly deported tens of thousands more Ukrainians. First, they targeted kulaks and when the Second World War broke out, suspected fascist sympathizers and collaborators were also deported. Now, the Soviet Union announced plans it will begin deporting all Ukrainians from Central Asia back to the Ukraine. The news will be especially welcomed by the recent, forced deportees. However, there are many thousands who have called Central Asia their home for generations, and they are reportedly unhappy with the planned deportations. It appears the Soviet Union is heavily committed to establishing and restoring ethnic homogeny across its Socialist Republics to foster unity and prevent potential sources of unrest."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.8.d:0 "Soviet officials have not commented on reports regarding Chechens being deported to the Tajik SSR. Despite the denials, sources claim, as part of a wider population transfer program in Soviet Central Asia, the deportations are taking place. The reasons are not entirely clear, but it could be related to fears among Soviet officials that Chechens could represent a potential source of trouble to their plans. The overall aim of these recent population transfers appears to be a desire to establish ethnic homogeny across the Soviet Socialist Republics in the region and remove sources of potential ethnic or cultural conflicts."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.9.d:0 "After an extraordinary session, the Soviet Union announced the transfer of the western Kazakh SSR to the Russian SSR. This is a major step in the recent Soviet initiative to reorganize Central Asia. The territorial changes and population transfers are part of a concerted effort to make the Soviet Socialist Republics more ethnically homogenous and reduce the prospect of future ethnic or cultural conflicts in these areas. The territory ceded consists of a large Russian-majority population and fits with the policy. Although the decision is being widely praised across the tightly controlled Soviet press, the move will likely lead to disruption in the region and among the populations directly effected."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.10.d:0 "Since the start of the Second World War, the Soviet Union has deported large number of Germans to the Kazakh SSR. When the war broke out, the Volga German population was rapidly deported out of fears they would join the German invaders. During a recent anti-Soviet uprising in East Germany, Germans even suspected of involvement in the protests were rounded up and deported as well. With a large, concentrated population of Soviet Germans and East Germans, the state has decided to establish a new German Soviet Socialist Republic. The Kazakh SSR lands occupied by these German deportees is being ceded to the new entity. The decision reflects the recent effort by the Soviets to reorganize Soviet Central Asia and ensure the Soviet Socialist Republics are ethnically homogenous."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.11.d:0 "The Soviet Union, as part of its efforts to reorganize Soviet Central Asia and restore the homogeneity of its Soviet Socialist Republics announced the establishment of a Korean Soviet Socialist Republic. The land for the new entity is being taken from the far eastern territory of the Kazakh SSR. The population will consist of existing Korean communities in the area, Sakhailan Koreans, and the large number of communist Korean refugees who fled Korea following the Korean War. The Soviets hope its policy will reduce the possibility of ethnic or cultural conflicts in the region."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.12.d:0 "The Soviet Union recently announced a policy of reorganizing Soviet Central Asian Socialist Republics to reduce the potential for ethnic or cultural conflict and ensure nationalities are represented by their own governments. As part of this effort, the Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic has been ceded to the Kazakh SSR. This returns a large Kazakh population back to the Kazakh SSR. It is also being seen as a way to keep the Kazakh SSR relevant as much of its territory has been transferred to existing or new Soviet Socialist Republics. The dramatic territorial changes and population exchanges have completely disrupted the region, and many Soviet citizens regions are no doubt wondering what the future will now hold for them."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.13.d:0 "Reports from the Soviet Union indicate a massive deportation is underway in the Azerbaijan SSR. The Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhchivan are being removed from the region. Soviet officials are not commenting on the matter, but it appears to be a move meant to calm potential unrest in the region. Analysts note the deportations were likely planned and directly approved by the highest levels of the Soviet Union. Historically, the region has seen continuous incidents of violence between Armenian and Azeri populations living side by side for generations. Moving the Armenians may be an attempt to calm tensions and make Azerbaijan more homogenous."
 Swf_Later_Stalin.14.d:0 "In one of the biggest shakeups seen in the Caucasus since the 1920s, the regions of Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhchivan have been transferred to Armenia SSR from Azerbaijan SSR. The Soviets likely hope the move will make administration more streamlined in the region and prevent the possibility of future conflict between Armenian and Azeri villages. These regions possess Armenian and Azeri villages, though with an Armenian majority. Experts believe this major shift could only have occurred with the approval of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin."

 Brezhnev_Pol.10.d:0 "Nikita Khrushchev, despite his claims of doing the opposite, ruled as a dictator and sidelined party leaders. Leonid Brezhnev and the Politburo denounced these practices as backward and against the spirit of Marxist-Leninism. Brezhnev went as far as to cite Lenin as someone who always praised collective leadership. It would be natural to return to such practices. At a recent Politburo meeting, the restoration of collective leadership was announced as a means to prevent the concentration of power into one person. The government is publicly praising the decision as restoration of Marxist-Leninist practice. Senior party members will soon receive important responsibilities and Brezhnev will govern through consultation and consensus."
 Brezhnev_Pol.2.d:0 "Following the removal of Khrushchev the new Soviet leadership continued policies meant to distance themselves from him and his powerbase. This has seen the return of the old guard within the Communist Party. Under Khrushchev these men had long been sidelined or placed in low positions to keep them away from positions of power. However, with Brezhnev in control and needing his own base of support, these men are returning to the Politburo and other senior posts. The Soviet media is praising this shift and highlighting the historical role many of these men played in the early Soviet state and during World War II."
 Brezhnev_Pol.3.d:0 "Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev recently launched an effort to streamline leadership and strengthen decision making by re-structuring the party hierarchy in a more vertical structure. Previously, senior party members would just report directly to the leader, meetings were scheduled due to personal relationships and not urgency. Often the leadership was dealing with trivial matters and neglecting major or pressing matters. Brezhnev argues this prevented the government from handling major issues effectively. Having a vertical structure will allow information to be more effectively channeled and prevent the senior leadership from being bogged down with minor problems. Those minor issues will be dealt with as it goes up the chain. Many in the party praise this more scientific approach to efficient governance."
 Destalinization.49.d:0 "The Soviet government has launched a significant media campaign to blame former Premier Nikita Khrushchev for the systemic, economic, and social issues facing the Soviet Union. Khrushchev is being accused of devolving centralized authority, contrary to communist doctrine to support his personal power. Khrushchev is also being accused of overly liberalizing society, leading to disorder and a breakdown in party discipline. All these problems combined to create a weak Soviet state and economy. The new regime of Leonid Brezhnev is emphasizing these mistakes as why the Soviet people are not developing as promised. It is hoped that blaming Khrushchev will buy the new regime time to build its own credibility."
 Destalinization.50.d:0 "When Nikita Khrushchev was in power, Leonid Brezhnev largely backed his policy of destalinization. He supported the rehabilitation of Great Purge victims, criticism of arbitrary governance, and a tolerance to criticism from intellectual classes. However, after coming to power, Brezhnev has begun a reversal of these policies. The government has warned against public criticism, with several authors already being threatened with arrest. The rehabilitation of Stalin purge victims has also slowed down, likely to halt. More significantly, Brezhnev has empowered state agencies to use repressive powers to control the public and detain dissidents. However, what is clear is that this reversal of policies does not mark a return to the extreme violence and mass arrests seen under Stalin."
 Maoism_SU.1.d:0 "The Soviet leadership under Leonid Brezhnev reinstituted censorship laws to reverse the liberalization policies of former Premier Nikita Khrushchev. These new laws have angered many Soviet writers who feel hampered by the government. However, literature which Khrushchev had himself suppressed, such as Maoist literature, is now being permitted again. Maoist critiques of Khrushchev are now being permitted by the Soviet government to support its efforts to ideologically shift the party back to what it sees are proper Marxist-Leninist practices. The Soviet government will continue to strictly enforce censorship against dangerous thoughts, but also support constructive writings."
 Sakharov.1.d:0 "Former nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov has turned into a vocal critic of the government and nuclear proliferation. He rose to prominence as a dissident by breaking norms by openly opposing a scientist involved in the Stalinist purges from being voted into the Soviet Academy of the Sciences. He later married a fellow dissident and advocates for human rights. His work is a major threat to social harmony within the Soviet Union and hurts our national image. To deal with Sakharov the security agencies are investigating his personal life while the media is being directed to actively criticize and denounce Sakharov regularly. The Soviet government is also encouraging members of the Academy of Science to also join in this mass criticism campaign to discredit Sakharov."
 Sakharov_HRC.1.d:0 "Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet intellectuals formed the Committee of Human Rights in the USSR as the first independent body of human rights operating within the Soviet Union. The committee regularly publishes reports on human rights and appeals for Soviet dissidents facing charges. Soviet security agencies are closely monitoring the group but recently it was decided the Soviet government would hold talks with Sakharov. The Soviet government used the talks to claim it takes human rights seriously and will consider the concerns of the group. Many believe these talks are a public relations campaign to showcase the Brezhnev government was not going to engage in the type of repression seen in the early Soviet state. However, it is clear from the talks the government maintains it will not likely compromise on its efforts to maintain social control over party members and the people."
 Brezhnev_Ethniciy.1.d:0 "The various Soviet Republics have continuously implemented laws and policies designed for their own ethnic groups. A universal Soviet system across all the republics greatly eroded under Nikita Khrushchev who promoted particularism and allowed the republics to govern themselves as long as they were loyal to the Soviet Union. For Leonid Brezhnev and senior party members, this represents a major problem. If these republics continue to operate largely independent, it is only a matter of time before they begin to embrace ethnic nationalism, and this represents a major threat to Soviet unity. The government is planning reforms that can reverse the cancer of particularism and strengthen the unity of the Soviet Union."
 Brezhnev_Ethniciy.3.d:0 "Some of the Socialist Republics within the Soviet Union have allowed backwards people to maintain their traditional forms of governance, often tribal governments. Allowing these unique forms of governance is a common feature of particularism and the main hinderance to establishing a singular, unified Soviet system of governance. To combat this, the central Soviet leadership in Moscow has directed the relevant Socialist Republics to begin the process of abolishing these tribal governments. It is not in the interest of the people governed by these archaic and backwards practices and removing them will accelerate the development of a socialist consciousness among those people."
 Brezhnev_Ethniciy.2.d:0 "Lioned Brezhnev and senior party leaders identified particularism among the Soviet Socialist Republics as the principle threat to the future prosperity, socialist development, and unity of the Soviet state. To combat this dangerous threat, the Soviet government announced it will begin appointing Russians to take over leadership across the various Socialist Republics. The government claims this is not an attempt to promote Russians over any other national group but reflects that Russia is the most developed socialist state in the union. It is only natural then that Russians are the ideal leaders to help the other republics develop their own socialism, which has been hindered for years by the particularism promoted by their local nationalities."
 11th_5ypfood.0.d:0 "The senior Soviet leadership has two candidates Nikolai Tikhonov and Mikhail Gorbachev are being considered for the responsibility of developing agriculture policy. Agriculture production has been disappointing in recent years and this must be addressed. Nikolai Tikhonov is a key member of the party old guard and throughout his career he served ably as an administrator, mostly in industry and metallurgy. His proposed agricultural policy will likely seek to adjust or reform current methods and policy. Tikhonov understands agriculture has underperformed but extreme changes risks disrupting production further. Mikhail Gorbachev offers a younger perspective and he rose through the party during the post-World War II era. He believes agriculture production in the USSR is in crisis and systematic reforms will be necessary to bring production up. He argues without drastic reforms, the situation will only deteriorate further. The Party must decide whether to go with the reliable Tikhonov or trust the young and eager reformer Gorbachev."
 sov_comp_purchase.0.d:0 "The Soviet embassy approached the State Department and asked for permission to approach a major American corporation in order to purchase technology meant to improve the day to day lives of Soviet citizens. The Soviet government insists the technology transfer would not hinder the United States and would increase trust and cooperation between us. Some in the cabinet argue we should let the Soviets purchase the technology, this would aid our economy, not weaken the balance of power, improve relations, and perhaps can help our intelligence agencies collect information. Others in the cabinet want to reject the Soviet request, they argue it makes no sense to surrender any technology to a openly hostile power and to give in would be an international and strategic setback."
 sov_comp_purchase.1.d:0 "The American government notified us their permission to purchase technology from them. The embassy is already reaching out to certain businesses and corporations to discuss prices and options. The decision shows the willingness and perhaps desperation of the Americans in maintaining positive relations with us. Upon hearing the news, some in the Politburo stated the technology transfers, will allow us to advance the country and eventually springboard ahead of the Americans. Others however, cautioned such an analysis and stated perhaps such transfers and positive interactions with the Americans can enable a new era of cooperation and peaceful development for the Soviet people."
 sov_comp_purchase.2.d:0 "The American government notified us we would not have permission to purchase technology for their country. This marks a blow to our efforts at modernizing the economy. We did immediately tell the Americans their decision jeopardized bilateral ties and indicated their nefarious designs against the Soviet Union. Within the Politburo the consensus was that the Americans lacked a desire for peace and the Soviet Union must remain vigilant and committed to the defense of Marxist-Leninism. It was also decided to issue a statement praising Soviet science and encouraging researchers to continue their excellent service to the state."
 sov_ibm_purchase.0.d:0 "The Soviet embassy informed the State Department their desire to purchase IBM computer systems in order to build a reservation system for the upcoming Olympics in Moscow. The computers would be for the Soviet tourist agency Intourist. The Soviets stated IBM would be willing to provide such systems if the State Department approved. We could give approval; this would highlight efforts at international cooperation in the leadup to these upcoming Olympics and offer a diplomatic opening with the Soviets. However, some Defense Department officials warn the Soviets may use these systems to advance their own computer technology threatening American advances in the field. We must decide whether to approve the IBM computer sale or not."
 sov_ibm_purchase.1.d:0 "The American government approved the deal we reached with IBM to sell us computer systems for our reservation system in the upcoming Olympics. Our tourist agency Intourist will receive the computers and it will greatly facilitate the international visitors, athletes, and media planning to attend the games. The American decision was an excellent sign of good faith and if these systems prove as effective as claimed, it could inspire a new focus on computers in the country. There are some concerns that the Americans may try to spy on us with these computers, but the security chiefs dismissed these concerns as the systems are for Intourist and not any sensitive agency."
 sov_ibm_purchase.2.d:0 "Our recent attempt at engaging with the Americans in the spirit of international cooperation over the upcoming Moscow Olympics ended in disappointment. We recently tried to facilitate the purchase of computers from the American corporation IBM. These computers would be for Intourist, our tourist agency, and setup a reservation system that would facilitate the travel of visitors from across the globe. In response to this simple request, the American government squashed the deal, showing their belligerence and hostility knows no end. The failure to acquire the systems will hinder preparation efforts, however, the Soviet people will not fail in their responsibilities nor will they forget this latest slight by the Americans."

 sov_sell_tech.0.d:0 "A high-level delegation recently arrived from Moscow. During talks a senior Soviet official proposed that we purchase technology from them. They noted the Soviet Union had the largest scientific infrastructure in the socialist world and such technologies could greatly benefit our nation. It is quite apparent the delegation expects us to give a definitive answer to their proposal. If we buy the technology, it will hurt our financial reserves certainly, but it would strengthen the bond between our two states. In addition, such technology may prove beneficial for us. If we reject the Soviet proposal, the delegation will certainly express disappointment and Moscow may become furious. However, a short decline in our relations with the Soviets may be the price to pay for our financial stability."
 sov_sell_tech.1.d:0 "A delegation was recently dispatched to [FROM.GetName] in order to discuss shared issues facing both of us and offer to sell technology to them. Selling the technology to fellow socialist states will strengthen the socialist world and help fund the numerous Soviet scientists and labs advancing technology in competition with the West. After receiving the proposal, the government of [FROM.GetName] enthusiastically accepted. They stated their desire to advance their people and do it through the knowledge gained in the socialist world. The successful visit no doubt strengthens the ties between the Soviet Union and [FROM.GetName] . Already plans are being made for future technology sale offers to eager and friendly states."

After receiving the proposal, the government of [FROM.GetName] stunned our diplomats by declining.

Of course this is likely lies, once the delegation returns we will temporarily downgrade the embassy staff and its consular services to show our displeasure."

 ABMT.1.d:0 "Premier Leonid Brezhnev and senior party officials have proposed to us an Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty. The proposed treaty would limit the deployment of such weapons only to ICBM sites and the capital. Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABM) systems are being developed by both of our nations to reduce the devastation of an all-out nuclear exchange. However, it is clear such projects are very expensive and risk starting a new arms race. Although we believe our advances in technology will give us an eventual advantage, some of our theorists suggest such a scenario may provoke the Soviets to strike first. The proposal appears sound as our military experts say ABM currently is not feasible of preventing nuclear annihilation. Accepting the proposal would also help relations with the Soviets. However, some senior advisors believe the Soviet proposal suggests their weakness in ABM research so we should reject the proposal and continue our own."
 SALT_II.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union is proposing a new series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks for both nations. This new treaty would actually call for the reduction of nuclear stockpiles to a specific cap. The treaty will also limit the development of new treaties, although current development programs in both countries will be exempted, this means future programs will be limited. The proposed treaty does not limit stockpiles dramatically and both nations will still have strategic parity, but it would halt the nuclear arms race and the stockpiling of such weapons. Considering the treaty does not dramatically change the balance of power, signing it makes sense, allow us to fund more pressing programs, and would be a great moment to garner international support. Despite this, some senior Pentagon officials are urging us not to sign the treaty and instead focus on developing more advanced systems push the strategic balance in our favor."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.1.d:0 "For years the Romanian communist party under Nicolae Ceausescu had deviated from the Marxist-Leninist line in terms of economic development, personal rights, and foreign affairs. Romania at times broke from the Soviet line on international issues and has slowly been withdrawing Romania from the Warsaw Pact military command, distressing Soviet officials. For the Soviet regime of Leonid Brezhnev this is unacceptable and a violation of his Brezhnev Doctrine. During a recent Warsaw Pact meeting, the Soviet government offered the Romanians a normalization of ties if they agree to purge their party of deviators and bring the country back on the path of Marxist-Leninism. The Soviet government noted Romanian socialism was under threat from internal forces and if did not correct itself, Moscow would not hesitate to help the people. The Romanian government must now decide how it will react to this challenge."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.2.d:0 "The Soviet Union was pleased to hear the recent news that during an extraordinary meeting of the Romanian Communist Party, it had decided to remove Nicolae Ceausescu and return Romania to emulate the Soviet model. Ceausescu and his allies vehemently resisted but they were outmaneuvered at the meeting. Pro-Moscow party members allied Ceausescu opponents, and others who feared a Soviet intervention to remove the long-term Romanian leader. Ceausescu was accused of deviating from Marxist-Leninism, counter-revolutionary activities, and corruption. He and his allies have been stripped of senior party posts and it remains to be seen if they will eventually face trial. The developments are a major victory for the Soviet Union and the Brezhnev Doctrine."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev has embraced a new doctrine in which Moscow reserves the right to save socialist states facing existential internal or external threats. Recently the Soviets asked the Romanian Communist Party to restore a proper, socialist character to its government and policies or suffer the consequences. Despite some efforts by dissidents within the Romanian Communist Party, the long-time ruler of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu survived and is now more firmly entrenched as leader. Once he secured himself he blamed the Soviets for interfering in Romanian affairs and refused Soviet demands. The Romanian government noted it remained committed to its revolution and socialist character and rejected Soviet claims to the contrary, suggesting the Soviet Union curtail its own ambitions."
 SOV_PLO.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union has long supported the struggles of the Arabs against imperialists and their regional puppets. In particular, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) has long committed itself to the cause of national liberation of its lands seized by Israel. In order to raise awareness to their cause and pressure the Israelis, the PLO has launched several spectacular operations, which the Israelis and their allies condemn as terroristic. However, the Soviet government has decided to instead call these actions the expressions of a suppressed people and pressure the Israelis to halt their occupation. Supporting the PLO will greatly aid our image across the Arab World and help us appear as a viable, non-imperialist ally to those Arab states and organizations like the PLO."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.1.d:0 "The situation has reached a critical stage following the passing of Comrade Stalin. Word has already reached members of the Politburo of the naked ambition of Nikita Khrushchev. Already he and his supporters are engaging machinations to amass allies and seize power for their faction. Depending of the actions we take in the coming days, we may be able to stop Khrushchev and his selfish quest for power. Through these actions we can act to ensure either the stalwart Lavrentiy Beria or the devoted Georgy Malenkov take the reins of power and save the Soviet Union from factionalism and personal ambition."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.2.d:0 "Prior to his unfortunate passing, Comrade Stalin had prepared a plan to remove traitors and corrupt members from the party. Stalin felt such an action would raise the morale of the Soviet people and ensure the party remembers remains dedicated to the state and their responsibilities. Carrying out these purges would assert the position of both Lavrentiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov and see the removal of Anastas Mikoyan. It would also cause panic in rivals such as Nikita Khrushchev and Kliment Voroshilov. However, Malenkov notes such an action could alienate potential allies and force conflict before he or Beria would be ready. The question now is whether to implement the purge or hold off on it until the situation becomes clearer."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.3.d:0 "Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria are seeking ways to secure support from the Old Bolshevik elements of the party. If Kilment Voroshilov could be brought on board, they would gain an Old Bolshevik and a senior Red Army officer. However, Voroshilov appears reluctant to back either man. One option to persuade him would be to gather or create some documents and witnesses which point at the military shortcomings of Voroshilov during the Winter War and Great Patriotic War. We could then use this to leverage Voroshilov into supporting us. However, going through such an extreme effort to force an ally entails risks and even then, Voroshilov may prove unreliable, instead it may be better to just find another hardliner to support us."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.4.d:0 "We were able to successfully gather enough documents and witnesses to convince Kilment Voroshilov that we possessed the means to destroy his reputation within the Party and the Red Army. He is so concerned by our information that he has pledged his complete support in the future. He has essentially become our man and now we have the support of a senior hardliner and influential military officer."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.41.d:0 "General Zhukov appears resistant to engaging in politics, but we have developed a plan and promise to him. In exchange for his support and backing, we would implement an Army Depoliticization Reform. This would greatly curtail the influence and power of political commissars in the Red Army. General Zhukov has long voiced his belief that during the last war, the commissars often interfered in the military efficiency and discipline of forces. With this promise, we hope General Zhukov will finally act and rally the Red Army to our cause."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.42.d:0 "Members of the Politburo have started to support and openly back Lazar Kaganovich to become the new Party head. Kaganovich, a staunch Stalinist was a well-known advisor and partner to Comrade Stalin. With his wealth of experience and devotion to the Revolution, there are few who can even argue why Kaganovich should not take over the party. Many are now scrambling to find a position close to the Iron Lazar."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.5.d:0 "The news from Berlin is troubling. The local Soviet forces had to use heavy force, including tanks to bring down the protests. Many in the Politburo note despite some of the liberalizing measures taken by Lavrentiy Beria it has led to scenes like the Berlin riots. To assess the situation in Berlin and determine what actions to take, Comrade Molotov has volunteered to immediately go to Berlin, calm the situation, and then send a report back to Moscow. Beria must decide to approve the Molotov trip or not. If Beria has secured or neutralized the main hardliners, such a trip would not be a threat, but if the hardliners remain independent, Molotov may return with a damning report on the situation."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.6.d:0 "Defense Minister Nikolai Bulganin is a potent threat to both Georgi Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria. During the war he forged close ties with the Red Army and in a crisis could bring military support to the ambitious Khrushchev. However, Beria and his agents have collected damning testimonies about Bulganin and have enough evidence to arrest him on several charges. Arresting Bulganin will aid both Malenkov and Beria, but Beria especially would benefit from the act. Choosing not to arrest Bulganin now is a risk, but it may be worth it as such an act could provoke unforeseen consequences."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.71.d:0 "After neutralizing Nikolai Bulganin, Lavrentiy Beria has now set his sights on Dmitri Shepilov, the editor of Pravda. With his influence over the media, Shepilov could rally behind Nikita Khrushchev and become a major threat. Using trusted agents, Beria can have Shepilov eliminated publicly. This will no doubt instill fear in opponents and clear the path for him and his allies to triumph. However, some close officers fear such an act may backfire and cause unforeseen consequences. The question now is whether to order the attack or not to."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.81.d:0 "In a stunning Politburo meeting, Lavrentiy Beria led an effort to oust Nikita Khrushchev from the Premiership of the Soviet Union. Beria and his allies were able to outmaneuver Khrushchev and his allies. This culminates the successful campaign by Beria and his allies to prevent the overly ambitious Khrushchev from seizing power and undermining the entire Socialist state. Comrade Beria will now look to consolidate his power over the state and Party. Of course, Malenkov is still a co-leader, but Beria secured his spot in the duumvirate. Their leadership is bound to bring changes such as a Détente Policy and a shift towards Consumer Goods."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.82.d:0 "In a stunning Politburo meeting, Georgy Malenkov led an effort to assume the Premiership of the Soviet Union. His rival, Nikita Khrushchev and his allies were unable to stop the actions of Malenkov and his supporters. This culminates the successful campaign by Malenkov and his allies to prevent the overly ambitious Khrushchev from seizing power and undermining the entire Socialist state. Malenkov, long seen as the natural successor to Stalin, will now look to consolidate his hold over the state and Party. We can already figure that Malenkov will institute a heavy shift towards consumer goods, but he fears for now that Beria has become too dangerous."
 SOV_Beria_Struggle.9.d:0 "The career and machinations of and Lavrentiy Beria came to an end following his conviction by the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. Beria, along with six defendants were shot soon after receiving their verdict. The arrest of Beria occurred several months earlier during a meeting of the Presidium. Beria was condemned by his colleagues and soon arrested by Red Army officers. Military forces soon swept in to detain his senior officers and secure his intelligence apparatus to prevent a coup or pro-Beria uprising. In the end Beria was convicted of treason, terrorism, and counter-revolutionary activities, in addition he was accused of using his position to commit hundreds of rapes and other deviant acts. His death will not be mourned, especially by his numerous victims."

 SOV_AFG.1.d:0 "Following the overthrow of the Afghan monarchy, the situation in Afghanistan remained uncertain. Despite Soviet backing, the government of President Daoud failed to initiate reforms and outside powers were organizing militant groups and subversions against the government. During the Saur Revolution President Daoud and his family was executed, leading to a more radical socialist government. However, despite massive Soviet support, the new regime has struggled. A recent outbreak of rebellions, especially around Herat, has led elements within the government to ask for Soviet aid. From the border, Soviet troops and tanks rapidly advanced as Soviet paratroopers secured key sites in Kabul. The Soviets insist they have been invited by the ruling PDPA government and once stability is restored, they will withdraw. Already the invasion is being met by international condemnation as many see the Soviet intervention and suppression of Afghan rebels as a blatant violation of international law."
 Brezhnev_POL.1.d:0 "Soviet forces have crossed the Polish border in order to secure the communist regime in Poland and crush the Solidarity Movement. Solidarity began as a shipyard strike against management for arbitrarily firing a worker but soon expanded into more strikes and expressions of anger at a stagnating economy. The Polish communists agreed to recognize Solidarity as the first independent Union within the Soviet bloc but the group has continued to question government policy. Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev saw this as a threat to communism in Poland and citing the Brezhnev Doctrine, authorized military action to end Solidarity and restore party discipline in Poland. Significantly, the Polish military and senior communist leaders are rumored to be upset and uncooperative with its Warsaw Pact ally. The Soviets apparently refused to let them resolve the crisis internally and now they fear the Soviet action will only strengthen the popular appeal of Solidarity."
 SOV_Detente.1.d:0 "The Soviet government recognizes the continuation of Cold War tensions has led to heavy military spending and a constant state of alert. The situation does not help the economy and hinders the ability for the government to provide for its people. In addition, maintaining a position of aggressiveness only causes our enemies and their allies to more firmly entrench themselves with one another. To change this, the Soviet Union had decided to embark on a campaign to soften its international rhetoric, more openly engage the United States and its allies, and try to reduce global tensions. This will allow the Soviet Union to focus more on its economy, improve its international standing, and by showing its softer side, it may be able to convince some of the neutral powers or even some American allies to re-align. The Soviet Union is looking to establish a period of détente or relaxation with the United States."
 SOV_VIN.20.d:0 "In a new diplomatic offensive being launched in the capitals of the major states involved in Vietnam and the United Nations, the Soviet Union is urging all sides to come together in peace. Soviet diplomats are emphasizing that the decades long violence must end soon and that the people of Vietnam have suffered enough. In addition to calling on America to reduce its combat operations, the Soviets also urged the South Vietnamese government to show restraint. However, in a shift from previous calls for peace, the Soviets urged North Vietnam to aid the peace effort by slowing the flow of fighters and engage peace talks with flexibility. Privately, some sources indicate Soviet diplomats have informed Hanoi that a failure to actively try to negotiate peace will risk a loss of Soviet aid. The Americans will no doubt appreciate this effort."
 SOV_Mid_FP.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union and United States are engaging in Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in order to discuss ways to limit and control the nuclear arms race. Both nations have immense strategic missile capabilities but the desire to update weapons systems and stockpile warheads are becoming very expensive for both nations. So far it appears the talks may succeed in agreeing on a freeze of current missile levels and limit the number of certain launch systems. Such an agreement would be well-received internationally and many believe such an agreement could pave the way for future talks which could ultimately guide the world towards denuclearization. Though many experts believe such predictions are overly ambitious or far into the future."
 ABMT.2.d:0 "The United States informed the Soviet Union that it had rejected the proposed Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty (ABMT). This a blow to Soviet efforts at trying to control spending and a new arms race. This decision indicates the Americans are planning on expanding its ABM research and is interested in finding a way to change the strategic parity currently in place. Soviet military leaders insist they have their own ABM research and will not fall behind the United States. In fact, one senior officer pointed out ABM is a very expensive endeavor and even if the Americans make advances, it would not be hard for an opponent to devise ways to overwhelm such systems with little effort or money. The Americans rejected these accusations and insist it will not compromise with foreign powers on researching technologies that can save American lives."
 ABMT.3.d:0 "The United States informed the Soviet Union that it has accepted the proposed Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty (ABMT). This is a great triumph for diplomats in both nations. The potential of an ABM arms race is now averted, and military departments in both countries will not have to expend resources on such projects. The big fear within the Kremlin had been that an ABM arms race could see the United States use its technological advantages to gain an unfair advantage. Such a scenario would have been destabilizing for world peace. Indeed, reports from America indicated one of the reasons they accepted the treaty is a belief that an American breakthrough in ABM technology may provoke the Soviet Union to strike first before it lost its advantage. Regardless of its reasoning, both the United States and Soviet Union are happy and hope the treaty marks a warming of ties between both nations."
 SALT_II.2.d:0 "The United States has rejected the proposals of the latest Strategic Arms Limitations Talks treaty (SALT II). The agreement would have seen both nations for the first time limit their arsenals, limit the development of new missile technologies, and reduce launch platforms. The rejection by the United States has puzzled some experts who note even the limitations in the treaty hardly weakened the capacity of either state to destroy the other. The Soviets are said to be infuriated and called the United States warmongers. However, an American diplomat involved in the decision-making process noted the decision had a lot to do with a recently discovered pattern of subversive actions by the Soviets, indicating they lack sincerity in terms of truly reducing the risk of global nuclear war."
 SALT_II.3.d:0 "The United States has accepted the proposals of the latest Strategic Arms Limitations Talks treaty (SALT II). The agreement will see both nations for the first time limit their arsenals, limit the development of new missile technologies, and reduce launch platforms. Experts note the agreement hardly erodes the ability of either side to strike the other, but it does mark an effort to halt the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the development of new delivery systems. The agreement is being lauded in both countries as a step in the right direction and hope it will lead to a warming of ties. Many hope such talks will continue in the years to come, eventually leading to nuclear disarmament. Both nations are said to be satisfied with the agreement and its implications."
 Sov_FP.125.d:0 "The Soviet Union recently shifted its foreign policy towards Western Europe. It has completely softened its tone. Instead of hostility or isolation, it has engaged these states in friendly exchanges which have facilitated a growth in trade, cultural, and political ties. With relations improving and many in Western Europe now optimistic for a future of peaceful coexistence, the Soviets feel the time is right to ask those states to end their post-World War II refusal to recognize the borders established in the Eastern bloc. Specifically, their has long been opposition to the East German and Polish borders. The Soviets will tell Western Europe that this keeps tensions high and if they recognize these borders, it will end a major stumbling block to European peace. If the Soviets achieve in getting an agreement on the borders this will also raise Soviet standing among its Warsaw Pact allies."
 Brezhnev.1.d:0 "For Leonid Brezhnev and his senior partners in the Soviet government, one of the greatest mistakes of the previous government was its tolerance to of multiple socialism. This caused many communist states to diverge from accepted Marxist-Leninism practice and away from the Soviet model. In addition, outside forces funded by capitalist interests often try to subvert regimes to facilitate a turn to capitalism. To combat this, Brezhnev announced a new doctrine being called the Brezhnev Doctrine. The Soviet Union has the right to militarily intervene in any socialist or communist state facing internal or external threats to preserve socialist society. National sovereignty does not supersede the interests of global socialism and the Soviet Union will act if needed. The new doctrine marks a flexing of Soviet strength. The vagueness of the language means only when it comes into practice will Soviet allies and enemies begin to understand the limitations and practices of the doctrine."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.4.d:0 "The defiant Romanian rejection of the Brezhnev Doctrine led to an emergency Warsaw Pact meeting. After consultations, the Soviet Premier, Leonid Brezhnev announced for the preservation of socialism in Romania, the Warsaw Pact would initiate military operations into Romania. He called on Romanian military forces to stand down and the people to come out and help their brother socialists in the liberation of their country from the tyranny of Nicolae Ceausescu. An immediate reaction was not given by the Romanian government. However, several outraged European states already stated they intended to bring the invasion to the United Nations. The Soviet action confirms its adherence to the Brezhnev Doctrine that promises military action to support any socialist state facing internal or external forces threatening its existence."
 ROM_NORMALIZATION.5.d:0 " The defiant Romanian rejection of the Brezhnev Doctrine led to an emergency Warsaw Pact meeting. After consultations, the Soviet Premier, Leonid Brezhnev announced the Soviet Union and its allies would continue its diplomatic pressure on Romania and continue to urge Romania to embrace proper Marxist-Leninist practices. The announcement has lowered regional tensions and fears of an impending Soviet invasion and many analysts believe the Soviet decision not to use military force shows the Brezhnev Doctrine has its limits. It is unknown of the Soviets decided to not act out of its own interests or if the Soviet leadership feared a military action against Romania would risk the defection of other Warsaw Pact allies who may not wish to participate in such an operation. Regardless, the whole incident indicates a limit to Soviet power and influence, which some are interpreting as evidence that the Soviets are losing control over the Warsaw Pact and global communism."
 SOV_Kashmir.1.d:0 "\nThe Soviet Union recognizes that India and Pakistan were both victims of capitalist exploitation and imperialism under colonial rule. To aid both countries they have recently offered to hold talks with the leaders of both India and Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir. Both countries reacted positively to the idea. When talks do occur, there is very little chance of an actual breakthrough but their agreement to accept Soviet mediation showcases the increasing diplomatic power of the Soviet Union. The Soviets in their statement also added they harbored no agenda other than peace and hoped to learn about from both sides. The Soviets also stated it is a friend to all the people of India and Pakistan and will always act as a global force for good."
 SOV_PAL.1.d:0 "\nThe Soviet Union announced it wholly endorsed the Two State Solution as the framework for peace in the Middle East. The Soviet government stated any other solution would be unjust and lead to never ending conflict. The Soviets added such a solution should lead to a return of Palestinians to the homes they had been expelled from their homes. The Israeli government simply stated it expected the Soviet Union to respect its sovereignty and security. A Palestinian spokesman stated it appreciated any state that recognizes the right of Palestinians to return home, though the spokesman did not address the idea of an Israeli state. The Soviet stance is seen as a way to add some pressure on the Israelis to be more flexible with regards to future peace deals."

 Solzhenitsyn.1.d:0 "\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn was recently awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. The acclaimed author is a vocal critic of the Soviet Union and its system of government. However, the Soviet government under Leonid Brezhnev announced Solzhenitsyn would be forbidden from collecting his prize due to his anti-Soviet works. Solzhenitsyn served the Soviet Army in World War II but after the war was sent to the gulags for criticizing Stalin in a letter. Under the regime of Nikita Khrushchev, Solzhenitsyn was allowed to publish his autobiography about his time in the gulag, reflecting the height of the liberalization under Khrushchev. However, his successor, Leonid Brezhnev has reversed this liberalization and has used state agencies and the media to criticize Solzhenitsyn. He has also ruled through consensus and many believe other senior members are directing the harsh government stance on this matter. The international community and intellectuals across the globe are criticizing Moscow for its decision."
 DevSocialism.1.d:0 "Premier Leonid Brezhnev and senior party members are all discussing the Soviet Union as reaching the state of developed socialism. According the Moscow, the current economic structure and direction of the state represent the most advanced socialist society in the world. All other communist states must strive to achieve this status and must not deviate from the course. Across the communist world, this argument is seen as a criticism to other regimes who have diverged from the Soviet economic model in recent years. These states argue they must deviate to adapt their society to socialism. However, the stance of Brezhnev indicates the Soviet Union are looking to push all its Soviet Republics and the wider communist world to end economic deviations and emulate the Soviet Union as the center of global communist economic advancement."
 Brezhnev_Constitution.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union adopted a new constitution during the recently concluded Seventh Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The new document confirms the Soviet Union as a developed socialist state with a unified people undivided by national identity or even profession. The constitution argues the party now represents not just workers and peasants but all people within the Soviet society. More significantly, the new constitution erodes the autonomy of Socialist Republics within the Soviet Union and requires all to confirm to Soviet laws and accept the supremacy of Soviet sovereignty. Soviet citizens are also guaranteed fundamental rights, but with limitations. The document confirms many of the leading ideas propagated by the ruling regime of Leonid Brezhnev and many are already nicknaming the document the Brezhnev Constitution."
 Brezhnev_Pol.100.d:0 "The recent memoirs of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, regarding his World War II years has received the prestigious Lenin Prize of Literature. Although the memoir is regarded as poorly written and a glorification of his minor contributions on the battlefield, not many in the Soviet Union are surprised. Brezhnev has long shown an intense passion for ceremonies and receiving awards. He has been given over a hundred medals and it is now expected that his birthday celebrations include the conferring of new medals and ranks. The numerous awards and promotions he gives himself are joked upon across the country and although Brezhnev has apparently been told of public amusement at his obsession with awards, he has brushed it off. For Brezhnev, if the people joke about him, it means they like him."

 SOV_TUR.10.d:0 "\nThe Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union both had a strategic interest in securing control of the Turkish Straits. The loss of the Straits to a hostile power risked trapping Soviet trade and naval vessels in the Black Sea. In 1936 the Montreux Convention decided the Straits would be policed by Turkey and only ships from nations bordering the Black Sea could use it. After World War II, the Soviets cited examples of Axis shipping from Germany and Italy going through during the war as evidence the Montreux Convention needed to be re-written. These demands of concessions regarding the Straits along with territorial demands on eastern Turkey turned the dispute into an international crisis. Eventually Turkey sided with the United States and the conflict receded with the Soviets accepting the situation but pointing out it still believed the Montreux Convention had to be re-written. Perhaps eventually Turkey can be persuaded to return to a neutral foreign policy or even join the Soviet alliance."
 TUR_SOV.2.d:0 "The Turkish Communist Party, along with sympathizers across key institutions have launched a takeover of the country. Many Turks reject the country's lack of progress on more democratic reforms and see the crisis over the Turkish Straits as more evidence that the policy of neutrality has led Turkey to a position of potential disaster. The communists have found high support in urban areas by Turks who see the government has slowed down or failed to follow through on the modernization policies of the republic's founder, Mustafa Kemal. They wish to see the symbols of reactionary life, religiosity, and conservatism much more firmly uprooted. The new Turkish regime has announced its hopes of fulfilling Turkey's march into modern society. The United States is said to be stunned by these developments while rumors have emerged that more conservative, religious, and Kemalist elements in rural areas might emerge as a resistance to the new communist government."
 TUR_SOV.3.d:0 "The crisis over the Turkish Straits took a dramatic escalation. After the Turkish government refused to concede to the Soviet demands to re-negotiate the 1936 Montreux Convention or surrender its sovereignty over the Straits, the Soviet Union has launched an armed invasion of Turkey. While control over the Straits is a key objective, the Soviets also have territorial claims on eastern Turkey. The Soviet government announced its soldiers would unite Soviet peoples with their compatriots who had been separated by borders created by the reactionary Ottoman Empire and preserved by the current Turkish regime. The Turkish government has called on international support in responding to the Soviet's \"naked aggression\" and said Turks must rally to the cause. The Turkish government cited how the Turks forged their own destiny after World War I and said the bravery of that time must return for Turkey to triumph."
 Berlin_Blockade.2.d:0 "The United States Air Force has pledged it can and will keep the airlift going. Although the airlift has proven to be very stressful, certain changes will be implemented to improve efficiency. General William Tunner, who during World War II reformed the India-China air corridor and doubled air transport in that theatre was recommended to take command. The French also pledged they would construct a new airfield in Berlin. Plans are also being discussed to merge with the British Royal Air Force's efforts to improve efficiency and coordination. As long as the airlift continues to function, the hope is that the counter-blockade against Soviet administered Germany will push them to blink and give in. While West Berlin is suffering, the counter-blockade has put a lot of strain on East German industrial development. Politically the people of Berlin are expected to continue supporting the airlift efforts. The citizens following the case in Allied states have also been supportive so far and are expected to continue supporting this policy."
 Berlin_Blockade.3.d:0 "\nThe United States has announced it will remove the Deutsch Mark from circulation in West Berlin. The United States stated its decision was not due to pressure from the Soviets but from a desire to aid the long-suffering people of Berlin and not play politics. There has been some applause among pundits and politicians in the West who support the United States for putting the people of Berlin first and believe the initial airlift had achieved its goal of demonstrating Soviet threats will not cow Allied resolve. However, there has also been opposition and dissent from other corners who see the American decision as a capitulation to communist blackmail. The Soviet government has welcomed the United States for \"coming to its senses\" but did not announce yet when and if the blockade will be lifted. Berliners are optimistic the Soviets will lift the blockade and are thankful for the help thus far provided by the Western Allies."
 Berlin_Blockade.4.d:0 "The United States government has decided to halt the Berlin airlift and declare Berlin to be an open city. The Western Allies forces occupying the city have been ordered to withdraw and the Soviets have been asked to lift its blockade to facilitate the troop withdrawal. Berlin will be an open city. Reaction in the United States has been quite negative, the action is seen as a capitulation to Soviet blackmail. Many are asking if the US will give up on Berlin, why would any other country trust the United States if they are threatened by the Soviets. Others however, have pointed out Berlin was an enemy city only recently and risking a wider war over it makes no sense. West Berlin was untenable and not worth the effort to maintain. The Soviets have said they are considering their options and are expected to respond soon. In West Berlin, the mood has collapsed as many fear what will happen once the Allied forces withdraw. The sense of betrayal is palpable and tensions are rising between Allied forces in the city and locals."
 Korean_War_Sov.1.d:0 "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) had been established under the leadership of proven, popular anti-imperialist leader and communist Kim Il-Sung in 1948. In 1950, after securing approval from the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China (PRC), Kim launched an invasion of the Republic of Korea (RoK). Despite initial success, a heavy US military response and deployment has led to a ferocious assault by the United States on the DPRK. With Kim's position threatened, the Soviets recognize the massive American military response may eventually lead to a threat to the PRC and a roll back of all the recent communist and Soviet successes in Asia. More significantly, such a scenario would leave the Soviet Union vulnerable in the east. As a result of these considerations and of increasing United States military involvement, the Soviet Union has decided to enter the war on the side of the DPRK. The Soviets will help liberate Korea as well as defend the DPRK and PRC from imperialist aggression."

 TUR_SOV.1.d:0 "After World War II, the Soviet Union sought to renegotiate the 1936 Montreux Convention. The 1936 agreement had allowed Turkey to police the Turkish Straits and stipulated only ships from countries bordering the Black Sea could use the Straits. However, after the war the Soviets began making territorial demands on eastern Turkey and voiced displeasure over the administration of the Straits. Recently, the Turkish Foreign Ministry was handed a note by the Soviet government. The note demanded the 1936 agreement be re-written and that Turkey give up its control over the Straits, perhaps Turkey should accept Soviet offers to run the Straits jointly. The reasoning given for changing the treaty was the instances where German and Italian ships crossed the Straits during the war, which the Soviets felt showed Turkey incapable of policing the Straits. The Turkish government could respond to the note by accepting the Soviet demands over the regime control of the Straits but this risks communist infiltration and Soviet occupation of key locations. Or it can reject the Soviet letter as an attack on Turkey's sovereignty. Certainly, this may risk an escalation by the Soviets but with the United States interested in helping, it may be the perfect ally to protect Turkey from Soviet machinations."
 Berlin_Blockade.1.d:0 "Since the Soviet Union instituted a blockade of West Berlin following its anger at the Western Allies decision to introduce the new German currency, Deutsch Mark. The United States and United Kingdom decided to respond by instituting its own blockade to Soviet administered Germany and to launch an airlift to supply the people of Berlin. The only way the Soviets could blockade the air would be by shooting down the planes but the Soviets would not cross that line. Despite the expenses and hardships on aircrews and planes, the airlift has continued, however, so has the blockade. As American leadership meets, it must consider its options as the Soviets do not appear willing to letup on the blockade. One would be to continue the airlift, despite the strain the airlift was having on crews and planes, valuable experience has been gained and certain changes on the ground could help expand the operation and ease the pressure. A second option would be to give in to the Soviet demands and withdraw the new currency. This will bring much relief to Berliners but will be a loss of face. Finally, the city could be declared a free city, this would leave the pressure on the Soviets to open the blockade to allow Allied forces to exit."
 Stalin_Purge.2.d:0 "Lavrentiy Beria, the former NKVD head and current overseer of state security had proven to be a critical hatchet man for Joseph Stalin. He oversaw the Soviet nuclear program, the Leningrad Affair, and the dismantlement of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. However, Stalin was growing increasingly paranoid of Beria who was consolidating his own power while carrying out Stalin's orders. Stalin sought to cut Beria to size and focused on the Georgian Communist Party where Beria had his strongest powerbase. A series of fabricated accusations were levied against leading Georgian Party leaders, specifically accusing the Mingrelians (a Georgian ethnic group) within the party of plotting with Georgian exiles and the United States to lead Georgia out of the Soviet Union. The resulting arrests and trials through 1951 and 1952 saw Beria's supporters in the Georgian Party purged, including First Secretary Candide Charkviani. Although the purge was said to target Mingrelians, it did target some non-Mingrelian Georgians, like Charkiviani. Ultimately the purge was more focused on limiting the influence and power of Beria. Despite Stalin's attack on his powerbase, Beria still kept his Politburo position."
 Stalin_Jew.1.d:0 "The Jewish Anti Fascist Committee (JAC) formed in late 1941 under the leadership of Joseph Mikoels. It acted to spread pro-Soviet propaganda abroad and emphasize the lack of antisemitism in the Soviet Union. Members of the committee traveled extensively to the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Canada to raise financial and material support for the Soviet war cause. The committee was hugely successful in its efforts partly by establishing close ties with other national and international Jewish organizations. It raised awareness to the Soviet cause along with millions of dollars in support of the war effort. After the war the JAC worked with American Jewish organizations to publish information on the holocaust and Jewish participation in the war. This annoyed Moscow who saw these efforts as undermining the Soviet claim the war was a universal struggle for all Soviets. In addition these close contacts with American organizations made Stalin in particular suspicious of the JAC's activities. Joseph MIkoels, the JAC leader, was assassinated and leading committee members arrested in January 1948 under accusations of bourgeois nationalism, trying to create a Jewish state in the Crimea, and working for US interests."
 Stalin_Purge.1.d:0 "Soviet premier Joseph Stalin had long been suspicious of Leningrad and its soviet leadership. His old rival Grigorii Zioviev had his powerbase there during the 1920s and Stalin felt Leningrad soviets had a desire to shift the capital and political center back to the old imperial capital. Following World War II, this suspicion turned to paranoia. The Siege of Leningrad made the city's leaders national heroes and during the siege allowed them to operate independently of Stalin's directives. Following the war, Leningrad leaders gained more positions of power in the central government in Moscow, gaining the most power it had since Stalin's rise to power. Fearing this new base of political power and the rise of so many young politicians, Stalin decided to act. In January, 1949, leading Leningrad leaders such as Alexey Kuznetsov and Nikolai Voznesensky organized a Trade Fair. Stalin directed the media and security forces to attack the event and laid out a series of trumped up embezzlement and corruption charges to his Leningrad rivals. In January,1950 the trials concluded and six leading Leningrad leaders were sentenced to death. The Leningrad Affair allowed Stalin to eliminate a perceived rival powerbase."

Khrushchev has stated that he has been betrayed by his fellow comrades and that this is a direct attack on the revolution. Brezhnev has countered this by stating that Khrushchev is unfit to be Premier due to him almost plunging the world into a third world war in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Leon Brezhnev said that the USSR will never allow Khrushchev again, and that he better be careful with his life now.

According to the post mortem medical report, Andropov suffered from several medical conditions|:| interstitial nephritis, nephrosclerosis, residual hypertension and diabetes, which were worsened by chronic kidney deficiency. We have already decided on a four-day mourning period. But now, we must also elect his successor. Our most likely candidate is Konstantin Chernenko, a man similar to Andropov. He however is already rather sick; suffering from emphysema and right-sided heart failure. Last year, he had been absent from his duties for three months due to bronchitis, pleurisy and pneumonia.

Nicknamed by the people 'The Seven Sisters', they were intended to show the West our industrial strength and prowess, as well as impress any visitors to our wonderful Capital. The most prominent of these, the Glorious Moscow State University Tower, has been completed today under the watchful gaze of Chief Architect Lev Rudnev. Rudnev has already built commanding edifices like the M.V. Frunze Military Academy and the Marshal Apartments, earning the respect and trust of the Party and Stalin himself. The Tower is set at the heart of the University Campus, and dominates both it and the Moscow Skyline. Over 400000 tons of steel and 130000 tons of concrete were used to make its foundations, and at 240 meters tall, it is the largest building in Europe, and 7th in the whole world. This truly is a great step forward for our great union, and although Comrade Stalin is unfortunately not with us today to witness its opening, we know he would be proud."

During the planned decrease of reactor power in preparation for the electrical test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near-zero level. The operators were able to only partially restore the specified test power, which put the reactor in a potentially unstable condition. At 01:23:40, as recorded by the SKALA centralized control system, AZ-5 button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed. When the AZ-5 button was pressed, the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began. As the control rods were lowered, the reactor output jumped to around 30,000 MW thermal, 10 times its normal operational output, the indicated last reading on the power meter on the control panel. After this, several explosions happened, which caused the reactor to blow wide open, releasing graphite on the enviorment."

The USSR stated that after increased Finnish-Soviet relations, they though it would be time to annex the Karelo-Finnish SSR. There is however a few people angry at the move. The Finnish population in the once SSR has been afraid of more Soviet control and less autonomy for them. The Soviets have stated that the Finnish should not be worried. The Soviets have been celebrating the new oblasts into the RFSSR in Moscow."

Joseph Stalin was a hard worker and helped his fellow comrades. His bright vision of the U.S.S.R. helped form a lot of the ideals and values we have today. He carried on Lenin's legacy. He will be missed. The Soviet Council will convene and decide who the successor will be. Whoever will it be, they will have to follow one of the greatest legacies of the U.S.S.R."

NATO has made a statement saying that will still fight the Communist threat no matter what and that this changes nothing. Tensions are still high in Europe and now have gotten escalated due to this 'new' military alliance."
 TUR_SOV.11.d:0 "It appears that after their conquest of the Bosporus, Stalin's guns have been turned on us. Today we received a troubling telegram that the Soviet Union intends to absorb our sovereign nation of Yugoslavia into the Eastern Bloc peacefully. They demand we allow soviet troops to garrison our country, the Black Sea fleet dock in our harbors, and the Red Air force use our airstrips for reconnaissance. While this idea seems laughable, they have promised that if we accept, Marshal Tito and the entire Yugoslav Government and military will keep their positions. Stalin has stated that he wishes to mend relations with the people of Yugoslavia and permit our two nations to once again march side by side in both peace and war. However, shall we refuse, he has warned that the entire Soviet Red Army will be marching down Belgrade by the end of the week."
 TUR_SOV.12.d:0 "After our successful invasion of Yugoslavia, who dared to usurp our authority and socialist brotherhood in Eastern Europe, we must make a decision.

 TUR_SOV.13.d:0 "Since Yugoslavia has refused to follow our socialist fraternal brotherhood in Eastern Europe, Comrade Stalin and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations have decided to impose a full embargo on Yugoslavia, in an attempt to convince them to turn away from revisionism.

This will serve as a warning to any other Communist nations daring to bend to the imperialist Western powers, who offer them economic bait."

The accused include General Otozo Yamada, commander of the Kwantung Army, as well as several generals in charge of the infamous Unit 731 and other medical departments.

Currently, Beria is being held at the headquarters of the Moscow Military District, and his loyal security forces are being blocked by elements of the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division and Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division. It is believed that Beria was arrested for treason, terrorism, and sexual predation, all of which are serious offenses, but it is thought that Beria was arrested to allow other members of the troika to gain power."

It is unknown where Khrushchev is being held, but it is an undisclosed location in Moscow city. It is believed that Khrushchev was arrested for treason and counter-revolutionary activity, although some Western observers see it as a power grab for Beria to remove a member from the ruling troika."
 SOV_Troika.3.d:0 "General Viktor Abakumov, Minister of State Security, has been executed. Appointed in 1946 by Comrade Stalin, Abakumov’s power was taken away when he was arrested in 1951 for not doing enough to fabricate a case against the Jews. After the Doctor’s Plot, Abakumov remained in prison, even after Beria and his deputy, Mikhail Ryumin, were executed. In December 1954, Abakumov was tried for falsifying the Leningrad Affair, a Stalinist plot to accuse members of the CPSU of forming an anti-Soviet organization, and was shot to death with three of his MGB deputies."
 SOV_Troika.4.d:0 "Today, in Moscow, 14 high-ranking Communist Party officials were tried for treason and counter-revolutionary activity against the government of Comrade Stalin.

In addition, Pyotr Pospelov, editor-in-chief of Pravda, was tried. All 14 officials were sentenced to death by firing squad, and further shows Stalin’s control over the government."
 SOV_Troika.5.d:0 "After the Trial of the 14, two more high-ranking officials, Andrei Gromyko and Panteleimon Ponomarenko, were executed. Gromyko, former Permanent Representative of the USSR to the UN, was accused of espionage to Western powers, due to his relationships with high-ranking diplomats and ambassadorship in the United Kingdom. Ponomarenko, former Minister of Procurement and First Secretary of the Kazakh Communist Party, was accused of corruption and financial abuses after being audited and finding that he was building a villa with Party money. Both were shot by firing squad outside of Moscow. The international community, especially the Western allies, are particularly shocked by the death of Gromyko, a beloved friend and foe in the UN."
 SOV_Troika.6.d:0 "Finally, even Stalin’s proposed successor has become caught up in allegations. Georgy Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Second Secretary of the CPSU, has been accused of adultery, corruption and sexual predation in a scandal known as the Golubtsova Affair, after his supposed wife. Malenkov met Valeriya Golubtsova, daughter of the State Councilor of the Russian Empire in Nizhny Novgorod, in 1920. They have lived together since then, but never officially registered their union and thus are not technically married. Being in such a high position within the government, this sort of activity is not tolerated and Malenkov has been tried and found guilty. What shall his punishment be?"
 SOV_Troika.7.d:0 "Earlier this week the Soviet government announced that the official transfer of power from the current general secretary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Joseph Stalin to the incumbent Lazar Kaganovich would be held on the XXth communist party congress in Moscow. The preparations for the event have already started as the largest ever military parade as well as audience in the history of the Soviet Union is expected in the red square. All this came as a surprise to western observers who had expected Stalin to serve as general secretary until his expected death. After surviving a stroke in 1953 his health has deteriorated heavily and many expect his death could come sooner rather than later."
 Stalin.Retirement.d:0 "The world was shocked today when news from the Kremlin in Moscow emerged that Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union since 1922, announced his retirement. Having assumed leadership upon the death of founder Vladimir Lenin in 1922, Stalin’s idea of Socialism in One Country, combined with his Five-Year Plans of Industrialization, created a strong communist country with a centralized command economy. Since his ascension, Communist movements have sprung up around the world and the Soviet Union is now considered a superpower with the likes of the Western Allies. World leaders have expressed their shock, although private conversations in the White House and 10 Downing Street are a mixture of relief and concern."
 CPSU20.1.d:0 "The Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concluded after meeting for over ten days. This is the first congress held under the new leadership of Premier Lazar Kaganovich, chosen as Joseph Stalin’s successor, and his first major public appearance since that announcement. Kaganovich made the Congress an opportunity to reinforce the anti-revisionist and anti-reformer stance held by him, and saluting Comrade Stalin for his service to the Soviet Union. He then talked at length about the Trial of the 14 and the executions of prominent former Party officials such as Nikita Khruschev, Vyacheslav Molotov, and others, who dared to change the socialist way of life. This speech has rocked to the very core the small reformer movement within the Party, largely hollowed out by purges and trials. The world has expressed mixed emotions, with the West expressing distress at the continuing hardline government, and Eastern Bloc remaining nonplussed about a change in their masters’ leadership."
 CPSU20.2.d:0 "The Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union concluded after meeting for over ten days. This is the first congress held under the new joint leadership of Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, having taken power in the troika struggle after Comrade Stalin’s death. Using the stage, the two spoke alternately, about the need for stable leadership in such trying times and the horrors of imperialism and revisionism, condemning figures like Nikita Khruschev and Nikolai Bulganin who dared to oppose them. Reactions about their speech has been mixed, with both hardliners and reformists expressing a mixture of support and enmity. Internationally, there is similar reactions; cautious hope for the future of the USSR lies ahead."

During our last class, we discussed the industrialization of the Soviet Union in the 1930s, and today we will focus on Comrade Stalin's excellent leadership, which saved us from the fascist threat of the Third Reich...These types of lectures were commonplace throughout the Soviet Union as the next generation studied hard to become productive members of the socialist society. The Soviet teachers had a challenging task in understanding the curriculum to properly present the life and legacy of Joseph Stalin, an incredibly complex leader."
 SOV_KAG.2.desc:0 "Komsomolskaya Pravda published another story today about the founding fathers of the Soviet Union. The front page contains a summary of the life of Vladimir Illyich Lenin. Starting with his humble beginnings and his gradual turn to the revolutionary side after witnessing his brother’s death by the Tsar’s troops. During the Great War Lenin was exiled in Switzerland but not even a vast distance from his motherland could stop him from trying to bring power to the people. He wrote letters and pamphlets that were later distributed on Petrograd's streets. Later renamed Leningrad in his honor. After the revolution, his circle of associates grew, including his successor Joseph Stalin. But before Lenin could achieve his dreams of bringing the glory of socialism to the world he suffered a stroke. That did not stop him from fulfilling his duties until his untimely passing. It paid off, however, as the movement he started and the Union he created were strong enough to resist the fascist threat and safeguard the revolution for decades to come!"

Its leader, the General Secretary of the Communist Party Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin has passed away. From the scarce reports coming out of the Kremlin, it seems Joseph Stalin passed away peacefully in his Kuntsevo dacha near Moscow. The preparations are underway for his funeral which will be no short of magnificent. Politicians of the Socialist world have already sent their condolences and will surely arrive to meet Comrade Stalin one last time before his final rest. On the other hand, his victims and the millions of people he put into gulags are secretly celebrating."

Therefore, in our hearts, in our minds, in our souls, you will always live on!" said Lazar Kaganovich in the final paragraph of his speech opening the 21st All-Union Communist Party Congress. Despite the grim atmosphere of the Man of Iron passing, he was rewarded with a ten-minute standing ovation. Kaganovich had to resort to using Stalin’s buzzer to calm the room before returning to his seat.\nNext was Vyacheslav Molotov, who reiterated the speech of Comrade Kaganovich, however, in a much more somber tone. He said that it was good fate that Stalin passed in his dacha, as it was the place where he has seen him most happy. But he added that the course set by him needs to be followed and his work continued. For which he earned a nod from Iron Lazar.\nFollowing the speeches of the other members of the Politburo, Comrade Kaganovich returned to the stage to present the main topic of this year's Congress, his reforms to the Soviet system, which many started to dub "Kaganovichism".\nOne of its tenets is a return to a low-level inter-party democracy to ease the replacement of junior party members either upwards to better positions or out of the party and to make the lower echelons of the state more responsive and efficient. The implementation of term limits for the position of General Secretary is concurrent with this goal. The final big issue Lazar Kaganovich seeks to eradicate is corruption within the state for which he will present a plan in the coming days."
 SOV_KAG.9.desc:0 "As he already outlined during the Congress, Comrade Kaganovich aims to eradicate corruption from the state apparatus. Several proposals for punishment have been put forward in a law similar to the one against Social Parasitism. In this iteration, it is those who misuse their position and the work of others to their benefit. The specific punishments will vary on the number of Rubles the perpetrator has acquired through his dishonest actions, from property seizure, years in prison, eviction from the Party, and relocation to a faraway region of the Union."
 SOV_KAG.10.desc:0 "The opening of the 22nd Congress of the CPSU took place today. The importance of this Congress lies in the actual summing up of the struggle between supporters and opponents of applied cybernetics, invisible to the general public, but noticeably reflected in the results of the 8th Five-Year Plan and the well-being of the people. Secretary General Lazar Kaganovich opened the Congress with an introductory speech, in which objective results were listed - which indicators were achieved in full, and which only partially. At first calmly listening, some of the Congress delegates turned to disapproving whistles, hoots and cheers, shouting about "squandering the people's wealth", "thoughtless experiments" and "an attempt to push the Party aside and usurp power." Delegates who supported Kaganovich tried to outshout his haters, talking about anti-popular elements in the party who interfered with cybernetization in the same way that wreckers sabotaged industrialization, and about the deliberate failure to implement the decisions of the previous Congress. After the allotted time, Lazar Kaganovich, obviously alarmed by the unceasing disputes, but trying not to show it, called the delegates to order, and when the noise stopped, gave way to the next speaker."
 SOV_KAG.11.desc:0 "The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party is underway in Moscow and there are reports of incoming change in leadership of the Soviet Union. According to the internal party bulletin, Lazar Kaganovich has announced his resignation from the post of the General Secretary of the Communist Party and there was a vote for his replacement the very next day.\nTwo candidates were considered. First was Dmitry Ustinov, a Soviet general responsible for the Soviet military–industrial complex. His main propositions are an intensification of OGAS development with military integration, civil defence investments, underground factories beyond Urals and a more active involvment in foreign activities. Second was Alexander Shelepin, who caught the eye of Stalin after he organized the partisan movements in the Moscow region and his crucial role in Komsomol Youth Organization."
