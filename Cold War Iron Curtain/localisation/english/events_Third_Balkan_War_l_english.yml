 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.0.d:0 "The recent proclamation of Enosis by the Greek Cypriot community and Greek government has led to a major international crisis. Internationally, Greece faces accusations of undermining international agreements to secure its own interests. Turkey and its people are especially angry as many feels Enosis will see a new round of expulsions and a cultural assault on the Turkish Cypriot community. Already, many Turkish community leaders are visiting Turkey to rally public support. The small Turkish military force on the island, working with local Turkish militias is said to have occupied the northern part of Cyprus. Greek troops and their supporters on have formed a perimeter around the Turkish lines as many fear this Enosis Crisis may lead to open hostilities."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.1.d:0 "The Turkish troops stationed in Cyprus, working with local Cypriot Turkish militias, occupied the Turkish neighborhoods to the north of the island following the proclamation of Enosis. Greek troops on the island organized a perimeter to prevent Greek Cypriot forces from engaging the Turkish military. The Turkish government refuses to accept Enosis, claiming it will lead to the cultural eradication of the Turkish community on the island. Despite their claim to be a defensive force, the Turkish occupation represents a potentially hostile enemy beachhead. We can try to seek a partition with Turkey or issue a two-week ultimatum for Turkey to vacate the island."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.2.d:0 "The government of Greece released a statement calling for both sides to reduce tensions in Cyprus and accept the current division of territory. It noted the people of Cyprus clearly embraced Enosis, but the Greek government understands the concerns of Turkey with regards to the Turkish Cypriots. Greece does not appear interested in escalating the current tension and is seeking to resolve it quickly. The Turkish government faces a dilemma as there is mixed feelings to the Greek overture. Many officials see it as a means to prevent a wider conflict while allowing Turkey to protect its interests on the island. However, there are also a large number of officials, especially in the military, who view the agreement as a means for Greece to buy time and eventually seize the island in the near future."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.3.d:0 "The Turkish government flatly rejected the Greek offer to partition Cyprus. Turkey believes strongly such an agreement would not lead to lasting peace and would reward Greece for blatantly violating international agreements related to Cyprus. The Turkish government appears focused on not just securing its interests in Cyprus but also preventing any Greek control over the island. Greece has not replied to the offer, though the decision will likely enflame the passions of people in both nations. Diplomats in both nations report there appears to be little effort in curtailing public anger."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.4.d:0 "The Enosis Crisis hit a new escalation with Greece giving Turkey two weeks to withdraw from Cyprus. The current tension emerged after Greek Cypriots declared Enosis or unification with Greece following the withdrawal of Britain from the island. Although the island is mostly Greek Cypriots, the sizeable Turkish Cypriot population opposes Enosis, claiming it effectively threatens their cultural identity. Turkish troops on the island recently occupied Turkish neighborhoods to the north of the island and have been facing off with Greek troops holding the perimeter. Greece accuses Turkey of holding the people of Cyprus hostage to its demands and for illegally occupying the island. It promises to complete the just unification of all Greeks. Analysts believe the Greek government is under tremendous pressure from a nationalistic wave across Greece after Enosis."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.5.d:0 "The Enosis Crisis has escalated into an ultimatum by Greece against Turkey. Both sides are proving stubborn on the issue. Greece certainly endorsed if not directly aided the pro-Enosis Greek Cypriots and it appears to be what most people on the island want. However, international agreements were made to ensure Cyprus provided representation to all its people, especially the large Turkish Cypriot population. By occupying Cyprus and refusing to hold talks, Turkey essentially forced Greece into demanding a withdrawal. If an armed conflict breaks out, it will pit two NATO allies against one another, which will greatly weaken the alliance. We must launch a diplomatic effort, with threats of sanctions to try and stop the conflict. Our mission will arrive in Greece first, then Turkey."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.6.d:0 "A high-level diplomatic mission from the United States arrived in Athens for talks. They are urging us to withdraw our ultimatum and guarantee the status quo in Cyprus. They note the United States will not pick any side in this current conflict and ensure NATO remains militarily uninvolved. More importantly, if we continue with the ultimatum, we will face immediate economic and military sanctions. The United States did not say we would be kicked out of NATO, more that our membership would be suspended. Our cabinet is divided, some believe we should heed the warning and step down, but doing so would infuriate the people of Greece. The hardliners note Greece can survive such sanctions, but it cannot delay a permanent resolution. If Turkey remains in northern Cyprus, they will turn its illegal occupation into a fortress and beach head for a future invasion."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.7.d:0 "Greece has agreed to withdraw its ultimatum with Turkey after holding talks in Athens with the United States. The Americans put immense pressure on Greece to withdraw the ultimatum. Reports indicate the United States promised severe sanctions if Greece started hostilities with NATO. The mission is now set to hold talks with Turkey. The Turkish government did not release any statement on the matter. The news has sparked angry protests among Greeks across the nation and Cyprus. They feel the government is abandoning its sacred promise of Enosis, caving to international pressure. The Greek military released its own statement, noting that despite the withdrawal of an ultimatum, the situation remains unresolved and the military remains committed to protecting the people of Greece."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.8.d:0 "The United States delegation in Athens left for Ankara disappointed. The Greek government refused to withdraw its ultimatum. It claims Turkey occupies areas of Cyprus that are actually Greek and the government cannot betray its promises to the Greek Cypriots who sacrificed so much for Enosis. The United States is said to have threatened sanctions if a conflict broke out and a guarantee that NATO would not involve itself militarily. Sources on both sides confirmed there were no discussions on Greece being kicked out of or leaving NATO. There are reports of patriotic rallies being held in support of the government for its decision to remain committed on the path of Greek liberation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.9.d:0 "A high-level diplomatic mission from the United States arrived in Ankara for talks. They are urging Turkey to show restraint and accept the current status quo. They note the situation cannot be reversed and further escalation will only mean war. The Americans claimed any escalation would result in immediate economic and military sanctions. NATO would be forbidden from being involved militarily. Turkey and Greece would also be suspended from NATO until the fighting stopped. The Turkish cabinet is divided. Some want to follow the American dictates, to avoid conflict or the risk of American sanctions. Hardliners argue the people will not accept a compromise and Turkey must remain firm on restoring Cyprus to what was agreed upon internationally."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.10.d:0 "The United States claims its diplomatic efforts in Turkey were successful. In a joint statement, Turkey stated its openness to accept the current status quo in Cyprus, promising not to escalate the conflict. These talks conclude a whirlwind diplomatic effort by the United States. The President released a statement urging both parties to take advantage of this latest breakthrough to peacefully resolve the current crisis. The Turkish government stated it will not stop protecting Cypriot Turks and though it wants peace, its armed forces remain vigilant. The Greek government has not responded to this latest development."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.11.d:0 "The United States admitted its efforts in Turkey to resolve the Enosis Crisis were unsuccessful. The Turkish government remains committed to protecting not just its own interests in Cyprus but a return to the pre-Enosis status quo. Sources say the Turkish government appeared undeterred by threats of sanctions if a conflict broke out. The Turkish decision was well-received by citizens infuriated by what they see as a Greek conspiracy to seize Cyprus and expel its Turkish population. Privately, one diplomatic source noted the Turkish decision reflects the dominating influence of hardliners currently in the government."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.12.d:0 "After a frantic diplomatic effort by the United States, the Enosis Crisis appears to have cooled down. Both Greece and Turkey agreed to accept the current status quo, with both states partitioning the island. Reports indicate an easing of tension between Turkish and Greek forces in Cyprus. Capitals across NATO and the globe are praising the United States for facilitating this breakthrough. Despite the prevention of armed conflict, many Greeks and Turks feel their leaders caved in to American pressure."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.13.d:0 "The government in Athens is facing scathing criticism from different sections of society over its agreement to accept the partition of Cyprus. The government insists it is a temporary compromise and the situation will be resolved in the future. Hardliners believe by not pressing the advantage, Turkey will turn its area of Cyprus into a dangerous beach head. They also argue Enosis has not been completely achieved. Leftists accuse the government of caving into American imperialist pressure. Despite the setback, many Greeks look forward to bringing Cyprus into the nation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.14.d:0 "The Turkish government is facing some public criticism over its handling of the Enosis Crisis. Critics believe the government should have pressed the United States to insist on a return to the pre-Enosis Cyprus agreements. They feel the government betrayed the interest of Cypriot Turks. Supporters for the government believe the resolution preserves Turkish interests in Cyprus and allows the direct protection of Cypriot Turks. One thing all parties agree on is that Greece will not be satisfied with this partition and Turkey must remain vigilant."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.15.d:0 "The Turkish government announced its own two-week ultimatum to Greece. The Turkish government insists Enosis must be reversed and the constitution of Cyprus must be restored. The decision is being widely praised across the country, with pro-government rallies being held in major cities. The Turkish military released its own statement calling for the nation to stand united. The Greek government has not responded, but there are anti-Turkish rallies being organized in Athens. Many analysts believe the passionate public support in Greece for Enosis means the government cannot possibly accept the Turkish demand. Both sides are said to be mobilizing military assets."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.16.d:0 "Following the Turkish ultimatum to Greece, the United States announced it would place economic and military sanctions on Turkey. The American government stated that Turkey refused overtures to de-escalate the current crisis. Analysts believe the United States sanctions are meant to limit the ability for Turkey to conduct warfare. The Turkish government has responded defiantly, claiming they will not be deterred in its efforts to stop aggressive Greek expansionism. The United States has also called for an emergency NATO meeting to discuss a response to the escalating crisis."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.17.d:0 "An emergency NATO meeting has made several major decisions with regards to the escalating crisis between Greece and Turkey. The alliance agreed that if hostilities commence, both nations will be suspended from the organization until the hostilities end. All member states are urged to remain neutral. The alliance also agreed that despite the suspension, any outside power seeking to take advantage of an armed conflict would risk triggering an overwhelming NATO response. Turkey and Greece were not allowed to attend the meeting but neither government has indicated they will withdraw from the alliance."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.18.d:0 "With Greece maintaining its ultimatum against Turkey, the United States announced it would place economic and military sanctions on Greece. The American government stated that Greece refused overtures to de-escalate the current crisis. Analysts believe the United States sanctions are meant to limit the ability for Greece to conduct warfare. Greece has responded defiantly, claiming it will not compromise on its sacred mission to complete Enosis. The Greek military released a statement claiming the sanctions will not impact its ability to carry out its mission. The United States has called for an emergency NATO meeting to discuss a response to the escalating crisis."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.19.d:0 "The Greek ultimatum is just hours away from expiring. Over the past few days, any interest in accepting the demands has dissipated. The Turkish people and military are completely prepared for conflict. A Turkish withdrawal at this stage would be seen as abandoning the Cypriot Turks to their destruction. The government will soon release a statement rejecting the unjust Greek demands. Turkish military commanders are sending orders for its forces to be prepared for hostile action."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.20.d:0 "Reports from Cyprus indicates that Turkish and Greek forces are engaged in opening skirmishes. The Enosis Conflict has entered a new phase of open warfare. There are also reports of engagement along the Turkish-Greek border. Many analysts believe the fighting will not be limited to Cyprus and both sides will likely look to make major gains against the other. This is the first conflict between Greece and Turkey since the 1919 Greco-Turkish War. The United States has called for both sides to halt hostilities."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.21.d:0 "With Greece and Turkey not yielding, the United States announced it would place economic and military sanctions on Greece. The American government stated that both states are refusing overtures to de-escalate the current crisis. Analysts believe the United States sanctions are meant to limit the ability for both nations to conduct warfare. Greece has responded defiantly, claiming it will not compromise on its sacred mission to complete Enosis. The Turkish government also released a statement saying it will not abandon the Turkish population in Cyprus. The United States has called for an emergency NATO meeting to discuss a response to the escalating crisis."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.22.d:0 "Following the declaration of Enosis, Turkey seized parts of northern Cyprus, citing concerns over the safety of Cypriot Turks. The Greek government responded by issuing an ultimatum demanding Turkey to withdraw. As Turkey is a NATO ally, we must decide a response. The Turkish ambassador wants our full support, and many NATO allies will watch how we respond to the crisis carefully. A lack of support could lead some NATO states to feel the alliance lacks protection. However, there is a large Greek population in the United States which will not be happy if we involve ourselves. We can issue a public statement guaranteeing our support for Turkey, though we should be careful not to say what that support would be. This would hopefully scare Greece into stepping back. The other option would be to declare the issue a bilateral matter as Turkey intervened its forces on its own initiative."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.23.d:0 "The United States warned Greece over its recent ultimatum towards Turkey. The American government stated that Turkey is a NATO member and an act of naked aggression could trigger action by the alliance. The announcement will certainly give the Greek government pause. The Turkish government welcomed the statement, expressing appreciation to the support. Analysts note the United States did not promise an intervention by NATO, but the implication is certainly there. There are reports the Greek cabinet is likely to hold an emergency meeting in the coming hours."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.24.d:0 "The United States implied if we use force to justly remove the Turkish occupiers in Cyprus we may risk NATO involvement. We are holding emergency cabinet and defense meetings to formulate a response. Some officials believe the United States is likely bluffing, as many NATO countries will likely see the Turkish seizure of northern Cyprus as a provocation and not a justification to trigger a full response. Others go further and claim the Americans themselves would not be able to rally public support for action, considering the large Greek community there. However, there are many who feel the situation is such that we cannot risk gambling on a non-intervention. Doing so may cost Greece dearly. They advocate the government should rescind the ultimatum and look to resolve the impasse at a more favorable time."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.25.d:0 "The government of Greece announced it would rescind its ultimatum to Turkey. This is welcome news and promises we can continue to defend the Cypriot Turks from aggression. The United States openly supported our position, which played a major role in halting potential Greek aggression. We can accept the current status quo, but there is no guarantee Greece will not try some aggression in the future. Hardliners in the government are calling for us to issue our own ultimatum to Greece. We should demand they pull back their illegal occupation of Cyprus and restore the internationally agreed on constitution. Such an action may cost us American support but the Greeks may not be willing to risk it."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.26.d:0 "The Turkish government revealed its conniving and naked desire for violence by issuing its own ultimatum after we offered overtures of peace. Turkey is demanding we rollback Enosis to restore the previous constitution. For the people of Greece, this would be a major betrayal. It also would return Cyprus to its previous regime of incompetence and poor governance. Considering the public mood, we will utterly ignore these demands. Privately, the government learned from sources that even if it considered complying with the Turkish demands, it would potentially face a negative reaction from the military. We must prepare our forces for the coming threat."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.27.d:0 "In a stunning move, the Turkish government issued its own ultimatum to Greece. They want the return of the internationally agreed upon constitution in Cyprus. This action changes the dynamic of the conflict as it is now Turkey escalating the situation. We never promised Turkey the support of NATO for such an action. It is likely even if we wanted to we could not convince the American public to support us as the conflict appears too localized. We can indicate our stance. Turkey is a vital geopolitical partner, we can remain steadfast in providing them diplomatic and material support, though not military force. However, many senior diplomatic and military officials feel Turkey sought to manipulate our support for their national interests. Other states may try something similar, they suggest we take the stance of criticizing this Turkish escalation, it may even give Turkey pause before launching any action."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.28.d:0 "The United States expressed dismay over the recent statement by Turkey demanding Greece restore Cyprus to its previous constitution. Senior American officials were quick to call the action ill-advised. Despite this public criticism, Turkey remains adamant that the only way to resolve the crisis in Cyprus is to bring back the power-sharing constitution. The government in Greece has not responded, though many analysts believe if the government even considered withdrawing, it would risk a violent reaction from a population caught up in patriotic fervor following the proclamation of Enosis."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.29.d:0 "The recent crisis in Cyprus appears to have ended in a whimper. Turkey and Greece agreed to maintain the current division of the island following the Greek proclamation of Enosis and Turkey occupying the northern part of the island. Cypriot Greek nationalists recently overthrew what was seen as an ineffective constitution and proclaimed unity with Greece. This action resulted in Turkey deploying its own forces to, in its words, protect the Cypriot Turks. Turkey insists the island should revert to the internationally agreed upon constitution. Greece had threatened military action to evict Turkey unless it withdrew from the island, but cooler heads appear to have changed this stance. The Turkish government also stepped down from its stance calling for a complete Greek withdrawal. Reports indicate both sides are standing down their military forces."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.30.d:0 "An emergency meeting of NATO members stated it viewed the current Cyprus dispute as a bilateral issue between Turkey and Greece. The organization also noted that Turkey remained a NATO member and would be defended if it faced aggression by an outside power. Although the Turkish government tried to persuade NATO to support its stance at forcing Greece to restore the pre-Enosis political order in Cyprus, it failed to persuade the organization. Many members felt Turkey recently escalated the crisis by demanding a Greek withdrawal. Despite the setback, Turkey will be satisfied the organization will maintain its promises."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.31.d:0 "Greece rebuffed our warning for them to withdraw their ultimatum against Turkey. The Greek government insists it is upholding the wishes of the Cypriot people. It insists Turkey is instigating the current tension and is illegally holding parts of the island. The next step is to call for an emergency NATO meeting on the Cyprus Crisis. We must determine an organizational response. However, our initial inquiries indicate many NATO members may not be eager to push for an armed intervention. Greece holds a special place for a lot of Europeans culturally and there are many people who are sympathetic to their actions."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.32.d:0 "NATO concluded an emergency session on the Cyprus Crisis. The meeting was a bit divisive with members arguing the conflict was bilateral while others felt an armed conflict should activate a collective response. Turkey argued passionately for support from its allies. In the end, an agreement was reached. NATO released a strong statement stating its members will offer full diplomatic and material support to its ally, though it did not promise a military response. The Turkish government will be buoyed by the strong international backing but disappointed by the lack of a full military response. The statement also warned any outside power seeking to undermine Turkey will risk invoking a full response."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.33.d:0 "With fighting breaking out with Turkey, we face a difficult fight. Albania is an ideological partner and neighbor. Historically, we have cooperated in the past on removing the shackles of Turkish occupation, perhaps it is time to renew those bonds. Many in the party are urging the government to reach call on Albania to join us in our just struggle. However, there are concerns that involving Albania may provoke NATO. A decision needs to be made."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.34.d:0 "The Greek government has called for us to join them in their struggle against Turkey. Greece is seeking to complete its unification with Cyprus and punish Turkey for its intervention in its affairs. We enjoy an ideological connection with Greece and there are many in the party who want us to join hands with them. We can certainly join the conflict, though war always has unforeseen consequences. Alternatively, we could offer diplomatic and material to meet our ideological commitments while not having to fight. Those who oppose a conflict question the merits of involving ourselves at all and believe we should politely decline the call to arms."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.35.d:0 "Most NATO states are looking towards the United States on what stance to take with regards to providing support for Turkey in its conflict with Greece. Some of the more pro-NATO government officials want us to openly aid Turkey, this will offer us the ability to provide large amounts of aid. The other NATO states could then follow suit if they would like. However, there are those who feel Turkey sought this conflict and is seeking to profit, giving them open aid could send a negative precedent to our other allies. They believe any aid should be covertly provided. This limits the amount of aid but allows us the option to play peace maker in the future."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.36.d:0 "Before the fighting broke out between Greece and Turkey, the United States criticized the Turkish government for playing a major role in escalating the tensions. They and the Greek government appear equally responsible for this military conflict. However, Turkey is a NATO ally and occupies a vital geopolitical space. Several NATO states have also approached us stating their interest in organizing covert military assistance to Turkey. Our intelligence and military officials believe such operations would provide assurance to the Turkish government. Some senior diplomatic advisors caution against providing any aid, noting it would condone bad behavior by an ally."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.37.d:0 "We are facing a monumental struggle against Turkey. Its forces are preparing for the conquest of our lands and a restoration of a Turkish presence in the Balkans. As a non-aligned state, Yugoslavia should be interested in standing up to an aggressive client of the United States. Historically, our people have cooperated against Turkish aggression in the past and it would be natural to call on their support. Many are urging the government to call on Yugoslavia. Some are opposed to asking for Yugoslavian support, believing it may complicate a future peace settlement."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.38.d:0 "Greece has called for our support in their military conflict with Turkey. The Greeks claim Turkey is emboldened by its alliance with the United States and seeking to press unjust demands on all Greeks. As a fellow non-aligned state, many in the government believe we should offer support for them. One faction wants us to join the war to demonstrate the non-aligned states will not be bullied. Another group of officials want to provide extensive material support along with volunteers. However, some of the cooler heads believe an armed intervention is too risky, they suggest we offer diplomatic support."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.39.d:0 "Yugoslavia has condemned Turkey for launching a war of aggression against Greece. It also blamed the United States for providing excessive arms to Turkey, fueling their aggressive foreign policy. To support Greece, Yugoslavia has pledged material and diplomatic support. There are also rumors that Yugoslavia is allowing volunteers to leave and fight for Greece. The Turkish government condemned Yugoslavia but claimed nothing will deter its will. When pressed for comment, the United States stated it was monitoring the situation and calling on all states to avoid enflaming the situation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.40.d:0 "In a stunning development, Yugoslavia announced its forces would join Greece against Turkey. The Yugoslavian government claims Turkey is waging a war of aggression caused by excessive United States arms shipments to Greece. It added the non-aligned powers cannot let any superpower or its clients bully them. The Turkish government condemned the action, noting it was now fighting to prevent the occupation and expulsion of Turks across the region. Many regional states and major powers are carefully observing a rapidly escalating conflict."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.41.d:0 "The Yugoslavian government issued a blistering criticism of Turkey. They claim Turkey has embarked on a brutal campaign of aggression against Greece. It also blamed the United States for militarizing the region. Greece welcomed the announcement and called on all non-aligned states to stand with it as it faces Turkey. The Turkish government condemned the statement, calling it a misrepresentation of reality. Despite the strong statement, most observers note Yugoslavia does not appear willing to involve itself beyond providing Greece diplomatic support."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.42.d:0 "Turkey and Greece are currently at war. Greece is a friend of the United Arab Republic and fellow non-aligned member. Many in the country are sympathetic for its struggle to liberate the Greeks of Cyprus. Some senior military officials see this development as a potential opportunity. We can aid Greece and send our troops to liberate the occupied Arabs of Hatay. While Greece frees its people, we can free our own. Others feel such an action may risk the wrath of the United States, who control Turkey as a puppet. Instead, they advocate we should limit our support to military aid. If Turkey is defeated, we can deal with them at a later time. However, there are those who feel any of these actions are not in our interests and we should focus on providing moral and diplomatic support to Greece instead."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.43.d:0 "The United Arab Republic has strongly criticized Turkey for launching a war of aggression against Greece. It accused Turkey of reviving its imperialist past, in the service of the United States. Radio broadcasts from Cairo to Arabs across the Middle East are spreading this message. The Greek government welcomed the announcement, stating the Arab World understands more than anyone what Turkish occupation means. In response, the Turkish government brushed aside the statement, calling it irrelevant and based on a false narrative. Analysts note that despite the bellicose statement, it does not appear the UAR will intervene directly in the conflict."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.44.d:0 "The United Arab Republic heavily criticized Turkey for its acts of aggression towards Greece. In addition to its condemnation, the UAR military announced it would dispatch military equipment to support Greece as it fought for the liberation of its own people. Radio broadcasts from Cairo are emphasizing the parallels of Greece liberating Greeks to the Arab struggle for liberation. Reports from Athens indicate there are pro-UAR demonstrations occurring. The Turkish government warned the UAR that it will suffer the consequences for its actions at a time and place chosen by Turkey."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.45.d:0 "Senior defense and intelligence officials are reporting of a massive troop buildup along the United Arab Republic-Turkey border. It appears the UAR is considering a military intervention to support Greece and seize Hatay from Turkey. This would be a troubling development and may cause a Turkish collapse if successful. We must issue some response to this threat. We can issue a warning that any UAR military action will be met with our swift intervention in the conflict. However, if we are not willing to commit to an intervention, we can issue a warning instead. Many feel just this would be enough to cause the UAR to stop is plans."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.46.d:0 "The United States revealed the United Arab Republic was rapidly deploying military forces on its border with Turkey. American officials state it is clear the UAR is planning an intervention in the current Turkish-Greek conflict. The American government stated emphatically that such a scenario would result in a direct military intervention. The UAR is being urged to halt its military preparations. Cairo has so far remained quiet to the American accusations. The world eagerly awaits what will happen next."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.47.d:0 "The United States revealed the United Arab Republic was rapidly deploying military forces on its border with Turkey. American officials state it is clear the UAR is planning an intervention in the current Turkish-Greek conflict. The American government as warned of grave consequences if the UAR does not halt its threatening military buildup. Cairo has so far remained quiet to the American accusations. Observers note the warning does not guarantee a military intervention, though it does not exclude it either."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.48.d:0 "In response to accusations from the United States that it planned to invade Turkey, the United Arab Republic released a response. It vehemently denied the accusations, claiming the Americans were seeking to find any excuse to prop up its Turkish client. Despite its denials, observers note there had been significant military movements in the UAR, now it appears this has stopped. The American government dismissed the UAR reply but noted the current military buildup has ceased. The Greek government condemned the United States for seeking to find an excuse to intervene in favor of Turkey."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.49.d:0 "Despite our warning to the United Arab Republic, they have launched an invasion of Turkey. We believe the UAR seeks to seize Hatay and open a second front to aid Greece in its current conflict with Turkey. We must chose a response, failing to do so will risk undermining all our global partnerships. Our warning did not specify what response would be given, which gives us flexibility. One option is to provide a massive influx of arms to Turkey, this would greatly bolster their ability to defend against the UAR. We can also chose to intervene and launch military operations against the UAR."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.0.d:0 "The White House and Pentagon confirmed an operation is underway to provide a massive influx of arms to Turkey. The United States had warned the UAR against involving itself in the conflict and this appears to be its response. The Turkish government welcomed the support, stating its armed forces are more than capable of facing the current crisis. Greece issued a protest, warning the arms will escalate the level of violence and be used against their own forces. The UAR remained defiant, calling the American action as proof of its nefarious designs on the region."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.51.d:0 "The United States confirmed it will join Turkey in repelling the United Arab Republic following its invasion of the country. The Americans had issued a warning to the UAR threatening a response if it joined the current Greco-Turkish conflict. The Turkish government welcomed the news, stating its people are uplifted by the support from its key ally. The UAR publicly remains unconcerned, stating its forces and people are more than capable to face any threat. Privately, many analysts the UAR will be greatly disturbed by this development, its political leadership had gambled that the Americans would not involve itself."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.52.d:0 "United Arab Republic ground troops crossed the Turkish border. The government later confirmed that its forces are deployed to liberate the Arabs of Hatay and support Greece. This is a major escalation in the Greco-Turkish conflict. There are concerns in Turkey that a new front will drain its forces currently fighting against Greece. The Greek government welcomed the news, claiming the non-aligned world will not accept bullying from those states feeling emboldened by their superpower patron. The world will look closely to see how the United States responds to this new threat facing its ally."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.53.d:0 "Greece and Turkey are engaged in an armed conflict over Cyprus. Amidst this fighting, the United Arab Republic launched its own invasion of Turkey, seeking to secure long-time territorial claims. Since opening diplomatic relations, our intelligence and defense services have cooperated closely with Turkey. The UAR invasion threatens to shift the military balance in the region. Due to the risk of public backlash, the Turkish government prefers we both keep the extent of our relations quiet. As such we have three options to aid Turkey, one is to mobilize our forces on the UAR border. This may cause them to divert forces from the front. We can also privately, transfer military equipment and advisors to Turkey. However, there are those who feel it is not in our interests to put Israel at risk for another state, they instead wish for us to just diplomatically condemn the UAR aggression."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.54.d:0 "Intelligence reports and military commanders on the border report a massive mobilization of Israeli forces. We have also intercepted broadcasts calling for reserves to prepare for a callup across Israel. This is an unusually extensive buildup and its clearly linked to our ongoing conflict with Turkey. The Israelis may be looking to strike us while we are focused on liberating our brothers and sisters in Hatay. The local commanders are strongly recommending we ensure our border positions are strengthened and capable to handle any plot launched by the Zionists."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.55.d:0 "The Israeli government privately informed us they will transfer a large quantity of arms and advisors for our forces. The Israelis say they are sympathetic to our plight of being assaulted by the United Arab Republic and wish to aid our defense. This is welcome news as our nation continues to face aggression on most of our borders. For those who long supported close ties with Israel despite opposition from the religiously minded, the news is confirmation that our decision to engage Israel was the right one. We will work closely with the Israelis to ensure any transfer of arms and advisors are kept out of the public eye, so as not to enflame those in our population opposed to our relations."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.56.d:0 "The Israeli government condemned the United Arab Republic (UAR) for its invasion of Turkey. It noted the action highlighted the threat faced by Israel and all those threatened by the UAR. Israel also called on the international community to hold the UAR accountable for its naked acts of aggression. The United Arab Republic condemned the Israeli statement, calling a Zionist ploy meant to distract the world from their occupation of Arab lands. The exchange of harsh words has raised fears in the region that Israel may soon involve itself in the rapidly escalating conflict that began with Greece and Turkey going to war over Cyprus. Israel is said to have raised the military alertness of its forces on the border."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.57.d:0 "The Turkish government acted with cowardice when it froze relations with our nation. Instead, it cozied up to the Arabs and has sought to condemn us internationally. Currently, Turkey is fighting with Greece over Cyprus. The fighting is said to be intense. Our intelligence officials believe we can take advantage of the conflict and weaken the military capabilities of Turkey. They call for us to immediately dispatch arms and advisors to Greece. With these weapons and our support, the Greeks can hopefully defeat the Turks or at the very least, inflict heavy losses to drain their fighting capability. The action has a lot of support, but there are military and economic officials who oppose the move, saying Israel needs every weapon it has to face the Arabs surrounding our borders."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.58.d:0 "Privately, a delegation of intelligence and military officials from Israel arrived to visit our leadership. They have pledged to provide us with arms and advisors. The Israelis sympathize deeply with us, noting we are only acting to free Greek lands for their Greek people. Our own leaders warmly thanked the Israelis, saying this marks a transformation in Greek Israeli relations. The Israeli support is a great boost and confirmation for the justness of our cause. To prevent enflaming Muslim religious anger or giving Turkey a narrative to claim it as fighting a just religious war, we will keep these arms transfers a secret for now."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.59.d:0 "The world media in Athens all rushed to take pictures as the Turkish Army raised a massive flag over the Acropolis of Athens. Emphasizing the Turkish occupation of the Greek capital. Turkish troops are said to be patrolling the city streets in force while raising flags on every Greek government building or monument. Turkish troops are in a joyful mood, with many seeing the fall of Athens as the greatest achievement of their campaign. Local Greeks are largely staying indoors, out of fear and humiliation at the failure of their military to hold the capital. In the coming days senior Turkish generals and civil leaders are expected to arrive and inspect the city for themselves. A senior Turkish officer was overheard saying this victory should humble the Greeks."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.60.d:0 "After an intense campaign, Greek forces are firmly in control of Istanbul. Greek soldiers and officers arriving in the city are marching with tears in their eyes, overcome with emotion at reclaiming a city lost over five centuries ago. Since the Greek occupation began, the Hagia Sophia, along with other historical Byzantine sites, are hosting daily Greek Orthodox ceremonies, with Greek military personnel and visiting dignitaries attending. In a press conference, the local Greek commander noted the capture of Constantinople reflects the discipline, effectiveness, and desire of Greek soldiers to liberate their people and lands. Plans are underway for a massive parade to be held at Taksim Square to demonstrate Greek military might."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.61.d:0 "After intense fighting, the last Greek military position on Cyprus fell to the Turkish Army. Reporters on the island report the situation is tense, with Greek Cypriots often defiantly staring down heavily armed Turkish soldiers. In the Greek neighborhoods, the Turks are said to be in full combat readiness, prepared to handle any resistance. Turkish military leaflets assure the local population that their presence is only to restore the Cypriot constitution to the island. In contrast, the Turkish neighborhoods are said to be in a celebratory mood, with Turkish military personnel and civilians mingling freely. Cypriot Turks are quick to tell media members that it is the Turkish Army which saved them from massacres and forced expulsions. The Turkish government notes that despite its victory in Cyprus, the war continues elsewhere and the island will not be secure until the fighting ends."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.62.d:0 "After intense fighting, the Turkish pocket fell to Greek forces. Greek soldiers are heavily patrolling the Cypriot Turkish neighborhoods, claiming to be providing security to residents. Many Cypriot Turks have privately told reporters the patrols feel more like a show of force. In the major Greek neighborhoods, there are large celebrations taking place, with Cypriot Greeks and Greek soldiers both celebrating what they see as the completion of Enosis. Despite the joyful atmosphere, Greek military officers are quick to point out the fighting has not ended and the military will remain vigilant to ensure the island remains firmly under the Greek flag. One local Greek told a reporter that the people of Cyprus were finally returning to the Greek nation after centuries of separation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.63.d:0 "The United Arab Republic announced its forces liberated Hatay. It added the victory occurred due to the UAR successfully overcoming stiff Turkish resistance. The UAR President praised the devotion, spirit, and leadership of its forces. Foreign press released pictures of UAR soldiers walking through the streets, with locals giving them flowers and sweets. There are reports of pro-UAR demonstrations across the Arab World welcoming the recent victory. The Turkish government has not commented on the developments."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.64.d:0 "The Turkish flag is flying high across Aleppo. Our forces recently captured the city after fighting with United Arab Republic forces. The UAR started the war, trying to seize Hatay from us. Our forces not only defeated the invasion but have now seized this historic city. We can now take this opportunity to offer the UAR a ceasefire. They will accept a return to the pre-war borders. This would allow us to focus our efforts on Greece. The other option would be to continue the fighting and press our advantage."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.65.d:0 "The Turkish government announced a ceasefire with the United Arab Republic. Both sides have agreed to return to pre-war borders. The UAR will be humiliated by this result. It had invaded Turkey hoping to capture Hatay and its large Arab population. The Turkish military is said to jubilant, but now focused on dealing with the other threats it faces. A large victory parade was held in Hatay while the foreign media was taken to see the captured and destroyed weapons."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.66.d:0 "Our recent conflict with Turkey ended in disaster. We sought to liberate the Arabs of Hatay, but instead we suffered a humiliating defeat, including the loss of Aleppo. The Turkish government declared a ceasefire, allowing us to restore the pre-war border. There are reports of angry demonstrations across our cities. Many citizens are infuriated by the defeat, even the military is said to be despondent. Many soldiers are privately blaming their commanders for failing them."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.67.d:0 "The Greek Army confirmed its forces had captured Edirne. The commanding general praised the determination and devotion of his men in the fighting. Many in Greece are cheerfully welcoming the news, with many seeing the capture as essential for the liberation of Constantinople. Some newspaper editorials in the region are barely hiding their glee over the removal of Turkish forces from their foothold in Europe. The Turkish government remains quiet but notes its forces will not falter in defending the nation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.68.d:0 "Greek forces are now in control of Bursa. The media has published pictures of Greek officers visiting Ottoman historical sites across the city. The victory is a major symbolic victory for Greece as it now occupies the first capital of the former Ottoman Empire. The Turkish government is seeking to downplay the setback but it is clear the war may not be going as they had hoped. Buoyed with this success, Greece appears poised for further breakthroughs. The Turkish Army will find it difficult to maintain public support if it continues to lose ground."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.69.d:0 "After a daring campaign, Greece confirmed its forces are in control of Izmir. The capture has major historical significance for the Greek Army as the port was its point of entry at the onset of the 1919 Greco-Turkish War. The local Turkish population is said to be infuriated after the Greek Army put up signs calling the city Smyrna. Despite this, Greek military authorities have sought to reassure the population by putting strict orders for soldiers not to interfere with civilians. The Turkish government defiantly stated that history will repeat itself and warned all will be accountable if Greece targets its citizens. Many of the descendants of Greek refugees from the city feel greatly moved by this achievement."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.70.d:0 "The Turkish capital fell to the Greek Army. The fall of the capital has left many Turks concerned over the future of their nation. As Greek military officials search abandoned ministry buildings, senior officers and officials are holding meetings in officers once occupied by top Turkish officials. Greek citizens are gleefully reading newspaper reports of abandoned documents and items left behind by Turkish officials who were forced to quickly abandon their posts. Despite the setback, the Turkish Army defiantly declared the loss of Ankara will not weaken their resolve."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.71.d:0 "After intense fighting, Turkish forces are in control of Kavala. Turkish troops are said to be rapidly turning the city into a forward command post. The Turkish commander who captured the city states it will be a springboard for future Turkish advances in Greece. The Greek government stated the defeat is a minor setback and that its forces will soon drive the Turks out of Greece all together. Greek residents are said to be largely staying at home, with many worried about what the future holds for them under Turkish occupation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.72.d:0 "Turkey confirmed its forces were in complete control of Thessaloniki. The Turkish Army conducted a formal march to the childhood home of Mustafa Kemal, the founder of the republic. For many Turks, this is why the city holds such symbolic significance. For many descendants of Turkish refugees from northern Greece, they are viewing the victory with great satisfaction. For the Greek population, the Turkish occupation feels like a disaster, with many fearing for the future if the Turkish Army is not driven out soon."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.73.d:0 "The historical and strategically vital island of Rhodes has fallen to Turkey. The Turkish government released pictures of officers visiting major Greek historical sites. Turkish soldiers are said to be patrolling civilian neighborhoods extensively as a show of force to the local Greek population. Many Greeks are said to be infuriated with their military and government for their failure to retain control of the island, despite efforts by Greek leaders to downplay the setback. The Turkish Navy is said to be establishing a local command center to better utilize and control access to the port."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.74.d:0 "The Greek government admitted it had lost control of Ioannina, the largest city and administrative center of northwestern Greece. Although it termed the loss a temporary setback, the Turkish government claims it is now poised to seize the region. Turkish military officials are frantically moving into the city to establish an effective occupation authority. The Turkish government praised its forces for successfully seizing a city protected by enemy forces and difficult terrain. Many Greeks are growing fearful that the northern part of the country is increasingly vulnerable to Turkish operations." 
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.75.d:0 "The United Nations General Secretary announced a ceasefire is in place to end the current Greco-Turkish War. He praised the international community for coming together and bringing the fighting to an end. Greek and Turkish forces are said to have stopped fighting as both sides nervously await the final outcome. Both governments sought throughout the conflict to suppress negative news and exaggerate successes. Many regional governments will breath a sigh of relief now that the fighting has ended."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.76.d:0 "As Turkey and Greece prepare to enter peace talks, one thing is clear, Greece is in complete military control of Cyprus. The Greek victory on the island gives them important leverage for the negotiations. When the ceasefire was announced, Greek Cypriot neighborhoods burst into celebration, with soldiers being showered with flowers and sweets. However, reporters note the Turkish neighborhoods are under strict curfew with heavily armed patrols constantly in the area. A Greek officer noted these patrols are for the protection of all Cypriots."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.77.d:0 "As Turkey and Greece prepare to enter peace talks, one thing is clear, Turkey is in complete military control of Cyprus. The Turkish victory on the island gives them important leverage for the negotiations. When the ceasefire was announced, most neighborhoods were reported to have entered a state of quiet. Only the Turkish neighborhoods are especially bustling with activity. Turkish patrols are patrolling the more militant Greek neighborhoods, with the Turkish officers demanding civilians hand over their weapons to ensure security for all."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.78.d:0 "As Turkey and Greece prepare to enter peace talks, one thing is clear, neither side is in complete military control of Cyprus. There is a tense standoff between Turkish and Greek soldiers on the frontline. Officers on both sides privately told reporters they fear a minor incident could reignited the fighting. Although the war began over the final status of Cyprus, it spread to across the Eastern Mediterranean and the Turkish-Greek border. Civilians on the island are growing increasingly frustrated over the continued militarization of the island."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.79.d:0 "The war with Greece did not end in a positive note. Greece controls large swaths of our territory and are in a commanding position. However, we did manage to capture Cyprus, giving us a valuable bargaining piece. Considering the war only began because of the situation in Cyprus, our best hope is to offer Cyprus in exchange for a return to pre-war borders on all other fronts. This is really the only position we can take."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.80.d:0 "Our forces decisively defeated the Turkish Army on most fronts during the recent conflict. We hold large amounts of its territories. However, in Cyprus we suffered a setback and Turkish forces took over the island. We had initially fought the conflict to complete Enosis with the people of Cyprus. The Turkish government has offered a peace treaty, they will cede us Cyprus for a return to pre-war boundaries on all other fronts. Many in the government favor the deal, they argue taking other, historical lands from Turkey could risk foreign anger and bring large non-Greek populations into the nation. Taking Cyprus would secure our principal objective and bring a large, patriotic Greek population into the nation. Other officials want to reject the agreement and focus on incorporating more historically Greek lands."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.81.d:0 "Greece and Turkey announced an agreement to end their current conflict. The Turkish government agreed to handover Cyprus to Greece and recognize its authority on the island in exchange for a return to pre-war borders. The Greek military had inflicted large defeats on Turkey, occupying huge swaths of territory. But in Cyprus, the Turkish military gained the upper hand, capturing the island and holding it until the ceasefire. The agreement is being welcomed in Greece as the government finally achieved unification with Cyprus. In Turkey, there is much disappointment over the failed war and abandonment of Cypriot Turks. Despite this, many Turks are celebrating its forces and commanders in Cyprus for securing an island that saved Turkey from a more humiliating defeat."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.82.d:0 "A major public parade, with military and civil organizations participating marched through Athens. Pro-Greek organizations from Cyprus also sent participants. The parade celebrated the successful Greek military campaign against Turkey, resulting in Greece receiving Cyprus. The dream of Enosis has finally been achieved and many Greeks are not only celebrating, but remembering those who sacrificed their lives for this vision. In Cyprus, Greek officials and military personnel are slowly arriving to transform the island into a new province. Although Greek Cypriots are openly celebrating the new regime, Turkish residents remain uncertain for their future."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.83.d:0 "There are large, angry demonstrations against the Turkish government over its handling of the recent war with Greece. Large parts of Turkey fell under Greek occupation during the conflict. Many Turks felt their government and military failed to protect them throughout the fighting. In addition, there is tremendous anger over the agreement to give Cyprus for a return to pre-war borders and there is growing fear for the future of Cypriot Turks. Some opposition leaders accuse the government of sacrificing Cyprus to minimize the extent of their failure to conduct the conflict."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.84.d:0 "We are in a tremendous negotiating position. Our forces control major areas of Turkey, including many historically Greek lands. More importantly, Constantinople is now under our flag. The more hawkish elements of the government want us to take advantage of this military victory and push for Greater Greece, taking as much of the historically Greek lands as possible. The more moderate elements however fear such a move may provoke a strong reaction from the United States and bring too many Turkish people into Greece, weakening our stability. These elements urge the government to push for Edirne and Constantinople to finally drive the Turk out of Europe. A final negotiating stance must be decided soon."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.85.d:0 "Greece signed a peace treaty with Turkey, confirming its control of Edirne and Istanbul. The agreement has shaken the Turkish nation and caused panic among many European capitals. Many accuse Greece of overt territorial demands, noting the territories it took has large numbers of Turkish citizens whose future appears uncertain. The Turkish government found itself unable to counter these demands as it was defeated militarily and had lost large parts of its territory. The agreement is being welcomed across Greece as the first step in restoring Greece to its historical borders. In Turkey, there is a feeling of almost despair among its citizens."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.86.d:0 "The recent conflict with Greece and its seizing of our European territory is a major setback for our nation. Many in the country are infuriated with NATO, asking what the point is of being part of the alliance if it does not offer protection. Perhaps the future of Turkey lies elsewhere from the United States and its allies. Some in the government demand we threaten the United States with leaving the organization, others argue our future security depends on continued cooperation with NATO."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.87.d:0 "Our ambassador in Turkey wrote a warning that Turkey is considering leaving NATO. The Turkish government also hinted they may even look towards the Soviets instead. Turkey is infuriated over its recent military defeat and loss of territory to Greece. Many in the country believe NATO betrayed them with a lack of support during the conflict. We have two options, one is to offer a major military and economic aid package to rebuild the Turkish military and economy. The other option is to not offer anything, some officials suggest this threat may just be a Turkish bluff meant to gain aid from us."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.88.d:0 "In response to our threats of potentially leaving NATO, the United States has pledged a major arms and economic aid package to rebuild Turkey. They are urging other NATO states to help us rebuild our military deterrent. It is no doubt a very generous package, but there are many Turks who still feel betrayed by NATO. The Americans insist its aid package is only eligible as long as we remain committed to NATO. The government must decide if it will remain in NATO, receive the aid or if we should reject this aid offer and hold public discussions on future membership."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.89.d:0 "In response to our threats of potentially leaving NATO, the United States sent a message from its President urging us to stay. They did not offer any assurances, support, or aid. This is incredibly disappointing considering all we have lost in the recent war with Greece. The cabinet is infuriated by the American response. The only option left for our nation is to hold public discussions on whether it is in the interest of Turkey to remain a member of NATO or not."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.90.d:0 "The government of Greece is trying to capitalize on its military victory over Turkey. It is demanding large portions of Turkey, in order to form a "Greater Greece." If Greece takes these territories, it will dramatically change the balance of power in the region. More significantly, these claimed territories are occupied by large, non-Greek populations. Turkey is pleading for assistance. We can pressure Greece to scale back its demands, threatening sanctions and other punishments. The international community will likely support such an action as many worry a large expansion could result in a major humanitarian crisis. It could also empower moderates in Greece to prevent the hardliners from pressing for a major territorial expansion. The other option is to not intervene and let the situation play out as is."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.91.d:0 "The United States sent a secret message to our government. They are insisting we scale back our territorial demands or risk international sanctions and likely expulsion from NATO. The alliance cannot function if Turkey is so weakened that it cannot keep up with its responsibilities. They also say our territorial demands are unreasonable and will result in much greater instability. Considering the non-Greek populations in these areas, this is actually a fair point. Moderates in the cabinet are pressing the government to heed the American request. We can gain Constantinople and maintain our alliance with NATO. However, the hardliners believe Greece is at a moment of historical transformation and argue it must take all the territory it can."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.92.d:0 "The Greek government has rejected our requests they scale back their territorial demands on Turkey. Doing so would greatly weaken the NATO alliance and set a terrible precedent. The Greek government appears drunk with power following its victory. We must hold an emergency NATO meeting to develop an effective response. Many in the alliance feel Greece shows no interest in operating in the best interest of NATO and collective security. The Turkish government and people will be feeling quite devastated with this loss of territory, we must reassure them of our support to not risk losing their membership as well."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.93.d:0 "The United States called an emergency session of NATO members to discuss Greece. After it achieved a major military victory over Turkey, it has insisted on occupying large swathes of its territory. This decision not only destabilizes the region but also critically weakens Turkey, a vital front-line NATO state, like Greece. Efforts by NATO members, led by the United States, to pressure Greece to scale back its demands failed. Greece can no longer be a member and will be expelled. To protect Turkey from further Greek aggression, military and economic sanctions will immediately be placed. In addition, member states must decide if they want to offer Turkey a large military aid package or military and economic aid. Some members feel a failure to offer Turkey large support may cause it to leave the organization."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.94.d:0 "Following our massive military victory over Turkey, our government revealed plans to occupy massive amounts of Turkish territory. These lands form the historical core of Greece and must be restored. The United States, who act as the puppet master for Turkey, has threatened extensive sanctions from it and other NATO members if we do not scale back our demands. They indicated they would accept the occupation of Constantinople and the European Turkish territories but nothing else. Moderates feel we should heed the warning, pointing out taking much more land would bring huge non-Greek populations into the country. However, there are more hardline leaders insisting we not allow any foreign power to dictate terms to us."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.95.d:0 "Despite international outcry, largely led by the United States, Greece confirmed it would seek to control large amounts of Turkish lands following its military victory. The Greek government insists this is not a territorial expansion but instead the liberation of historically Greek lands. It did not respond to concerns regarding the place of the non-Greek populations currently residing in the land. The news will likely spur an uproar in Turkey, as the government there sought to downplay the reports in recent days. The United States expressed dissatisfaction with the Greek response and has called for an emergency NATO meeting to discuss the situation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.96.d:0 "The Turkish population recently learned the extent of territorial demands made by Greece. Efforts by the Turkish government to prevent news of their military and territorial losses cannot prevent the realization that Greece now controls vital Turkish cities and lands along the Mediterranean. Local authorities in Ankara were forced to call in soldiers to restore order after angry Turkish crowds, including refugees driven by the recent fighting, began attacking government buildings. There is a feeling of deep humiliation across Turkey, leading to reports from foreign reporters that many in Turkey appear to be in a depressive state."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.97.d:0 "Following the massive seizure of territory by Greece, NATO decided to hold an emergency meeting. All members agreed the Greek demands were excessive and unacceptable. Military and economic sanctions are to be placed immediately. The other matter is deciding how to support Turkey. At the moment, Turkey remains a member of NATO, though there are many in the country who feel the organization failed to defend them. Some NATO states believe the organization must provide extensive military and economic aid to rebuild Turkey and its relationship with its people. Others believe the aid should focus on just the military, to restore its capabilities. Considering the weakened state of Turkey, there is a feeling that giving any aid to them may be a waste."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.98.d:0 "Following an emergency meeting, NATO announced it would place economic and military sanctions on our nation. This is an overreaction to our just liberation of historically Greek lands. Our military forces achieved an overwhelming victory, and we refuse to waste their historic victory to appease foreign powers. These sanctions mean nothing, we will find new partners and will not be dictated to by the West and their hypocrisy. We do not expect much backlash from our own people who continue to strongly support the nation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.99.d:0 "Following an emergency NATO meeting, the alliance has agreed on providing us with massive military aid. NATO believes it is essential to restore our military credibility to enable us to meet our obligations to the alliance. More importantly, this equipment will allow us to ensure the rapacious Greeks do not attempt to take even more land from us in the future. Indeed, some commanders are suggesting we begin positioning the new equipment to prepare for the future liberation of our lost lands. However, these discussions must be kept private from NATO."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.100.d:0 "Following an emergency NATO meeting, the alliance has agreed on providing us with massive military and economic aid. NATO believes it is essential to restore our military credibility and economy to enable us to meet our obligations with the alliance. More importantly, this support will allow us to ensure the rapacious Greeks do not attempt to take even more land from us in the future. The senior leadership will hold meetings in the coming days to ensure this support can be effectively utilized to maximize our capabilities to counter the ongoing Greek threat."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.101.d:0 "The recent conflict with Greece and their seizure of our territory highlighted the limitations of our alliance with NATO. NATO had ample opportunity to aid us in our moment of crisis but chose not to. What support we did receive proved ineffective. Many in the country, especially in the media are pointing to NATO as an alliance that demands much but offers little in return. They also question, considering the Greek war, that concerns over communism may actually be overblown. Supporters of NATO admit recent actions were disappointing but overall the alliance offers many benefits and protections to Turkey. The cabinet will meet to discuss the future status of Turkey within NATO."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.102.d:0 "The government of Turkey announced it will formally withdraw from NATO. Turkish leaders then released a statement noting the sense of betrayal felt by all Turks as the alliance failed to defend it against Greek aggression. The goals for NATO were no longer compatible with the interests of Turkey. Many analysts believe Turkey is seeking to forge a new, more regionally focused foreign policy. It seeks to rebuild their capabilities and be prepared to face Greece again in the future. There is also a feeling among many Turks that the threat of communism, both internal and external was largely fabricated by NATO propaganda."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.103.d:0 "The war with Turkey did not end in a positive note. The Turks controls large swaths of our territory and are in a commanding position. However, we did manage to capture Cyprus, giving us a valuable bargaining piece. Considering the war only began because of the situation in Cyprus, our best hope is to offer the island in exchange for a return to pre-war borders on all other fronts. This is really the only position we can take, though our people will be pained at the loss, Enosis is not worth losing the unity of the nation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.104.d:0 "Our forces decisively defeated the Greek Army on most fronts during the recent conflict. We hold large amounts of its territories. However, in Cyprus we suffered a setback and Greek forces took over the island. We had initially fought the conflict to protect Cypriot Turks from the threat of cultural annihilation at the hands of Greeks. The Greek government has offered a peace treaty, they will cede us Cyprus for a return to pre-war boundaries on all other fronts. Many in the government favor the deal, they argue pressing for more territorial gains without securing Cyprus would only bring large non-Turkish populations needing an expensive occupation. However, there are those who feel we must press our gains and doing so will ensure the protection of Turks on Cyprus."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.105.d:0 "Many capitals across the globe breathed a sigh of relief upon reports that Greece and Turkey agreed to peace terms. Both sides will return to pre-war borders on the condition that Greece cedes Cyprus to Turkey. The Greek military had largely been defeated during the conflict, except in Cyprus and used it to negotiate the withdrawal of Turkish forces from its other territories. Significantly, Greece could not demand any conditions to the Turkish administration on the island. The Turkish government praised its armed forces and announced it will explore how to resolve the situation on Cyprus to the benefit of all parties."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.106.d:0 "Cyprus is firmly under Turkish control, only days ago thousands of Cypriot Greeks mournfully watched as the last Greek soldiers marched on their ships. Turkish troops quickly moved in to establish order in the Greek towns, venturing out of their bases in the Cypriot Turkish areas of the island. Foreign press reports indicate the Turkish troops are being largely ignored and shunned by Greeks but there are no reports of violent incidents. The Turkish cabinet will hold talks in the coming days to either restore the previous constitution and grant independence to Cyprus or maintain its military occupation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.107.d:0 "After long discussions, the government of Turkey confirmed it must maintain its current occupation of Cyprus. It cited the need to restore stability on the island and uproot all foreign elements before considering another solution. Turkish leaders were quick to emphasize this decision is not a permanent occupation and ultimately, they wish to see a Cyprus in which all Cypriots are protected under the rule of law. The Greek government released a statement questioning the benefit of maintaining a military occupation on the island. There were protests held in Greece condemning Turkey for its decision. In Turkey, the reaction was generally supportive, with most Turks accepting that the situation on the island needed to be more stabilized."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.108.d:0 "The Turkish military governor in Cyprus formally handed power over to a new caretaker government in the island. There are to be new elections in the coming months. The Turkish cabinet recently approved the restoration of the previous constitution, rolling back amendments passed by the Greek Cypriots who sought to put Cyprus on the path of unification with Greece. Although the Turkish authorities have been quick to claim they are restoring an inclusive constitution, critics note the constitution has been modified. Turkey is listed as the guarantor of democracy on Cyprus and Enosis is banned. There were large protests in Greece with many condemning Turkey for turning Cyprus into its client state."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.109.d:0 "Our armed forces, with the support of the people managed to inflict a massive military victory over Greece. Its forces were beaten, outmaneuvered, and overmatched throughout the conflict. Following a UN ceasefire, we are to enter peace negotiations with Greece. The government must determine its negotiating position, we will set the terms. One group, mostly moderates, want us to take the territory containing Kavala and the island of Rhodes. This will give us a strategic advantage and ensure Greece can never threaten us again. The more hardliners believe that peace option would squander our advantage, they want to retake the land lost in the First Balkan War and retake northern Greece. Opponents to this view believe the international community would not like it and it would be difficult to incorporate lands with large non-Turkish populations."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.110.d:0 "Following the recent Greco-Turkish War, Turkey found itself in a commanding position. It controlled large amounts of Greek land and was militarily dominant. After peace talks, both sides confirmed that Turkey would receive Kavala, its surrounding territory, and Rhodes. Analysts believe the territory will allow the Turkish military to gain a strategic advantage that will not be easy for Greece to overcome in the future. Greece remains largely subdued but there is a feeling of rising anger among its people. The Turkish government will be satisfied with the result, though it will need to content with taking over territory with a sizable Greek population."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.111.d:0 "Following the loss of territory in the recent conflict with Turkey, many in the country are questioning our continued involvement in NATO. They note Greece has suffered considerably in recent decades for involving itself in the wider affairs of Europe. In doing so, Greece is often left at the periphery. There are also many who believe the threat of communism is simply a product of NATO propaganda and the alliance offers nothing. Despite these criticisms, there are also defenders of NATO who are urging the government not to leave the organization. They believe NATO offers protection from existential threats and opens avenues of growth for the nation. The government is considering informing the United States that it may reconsider its membership to NATO."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.112.d:0 "Our ambassador in Greece wrote a warning that its government is considering leaving NATO. The Greek government also hinted they may even look towards the Soviets instead. Greece is infuriated over its recent military defeat and loss of territory to Turkey. Many in the country believe NATO betrayed them with a lack of support during the conflict.

The only option left for our nation is to hold public discussions on whether it is in the interest of Greece to remain a member of NATO or not."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.115.d:0 "Reports indicate Greek representatives leaving a meeting with Turkish representatives over a peace treaty to end the recent Greco-Turkish War left with a look of shock. It soon emerged that Turkey had essentially demanded control of northern Greece, calling for all land it lost as the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War. These lands represent a large Greek population and vital economic resources. Our analysts believe this will potentially destabilize the region, lead to population migrations and future conflicts. Many of our European allies are uncomfortable with this massive Turkish expansion. The President must decide to either allow the peace deal to go through or press Turkey to scale down its demands for the sake of regional stability."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.116.d:0 "The United States quietly informed our top officials that we will risk facing sanctions if we proceed with seizing northern Greece. The Americans insist if we take the territory, we will only perpetuate conflict and cause instability across the region. Some of our own officials agree, they believe it will be expensive and difficult to handle the occupation of so many Greeks. The Americans added they will accept a scaled down agreement, giving us some territory, but if we proceed to take all of the lands demanded, we will risk sanctions."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.117.d:0 "In a surprise development, the United States announced it will place sanctions on Turkey over what it terms to be excessive territorial demands on Greece. The American government stated its sanctions were meant to demonstrate its concerns over the wider prospect of peace for the region. The Turkish government released a statement expressing its dissatisfaction with the American decision. There are reports of anti-American demonstrations, but analysts are unsure whether these sanctions are long-termed due to their NATO alliance."
 
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.118.d:0 "The United States has quietly lifted its sanctions on Turkey. It initially put the sanctions in response to the territorial demands Turkey placed on Greece. Over the preceding months, the Pentagon and State Department assured Congress of its support to lift the sanctions. The White House supported the effort, arguing that Turkey remains a vital regional power that needs to be engaged. Turkey released its own statement welcoming the decision and looking forward to renewed bonds."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.119.d:0 "The United States sent a secret message to our government. They are insisting we scale back our territorial demands or risk international sanctions and likely expulsion from NATO. The alliance cannot function if Greece is dramatically weakened. They also say our territorial demands are unreasonable and will result in much greater instability. Considering the non-Turkish populations in these areas, this is actually a fair point. Moderates in the cabinet are pressing the government to heed the American request. We can scale down our demands to gain a strategic advantage over Greece, while maintaining our alliance with NATO. However, the hardliners believe Turkey is at a moment of historical transformation and argue it must take all the territory it can."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.120.d:0 "The United States and NATO put pressure on Turkey to scale back its demands on Greece following its victory. NATO fears if Turkey goes through with its conquests it will destabilize the region and cause further conflict in the coming years. More importantly, the weakening of Greece and instability in the newly occupied lands could greatly hinder NATO capabilities in the Mediterranean. However, Turkey indicated it will not be dictated to, claiming it will press on with its claims. Many Turks feel they earned their victor and are supporting the effort."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.121.d:0 "Turkey is pressing for massive territorial gains at the expense of Greece who they defeated in their recent conflict. As both are NATO states, the organization called on Turkey to show restraint, for the betterment of the whole alliance, they refused. An emergency meeting has been called, the organization will certainly expel Turkey and place sanctions. The question now is to decide whether to also provide aid for Greece. Many in the alliance feel the organization should help rebuild Greece, but there are those who feel giving aid may only fuel Turkey to find alternative allies, inviting more instability."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.122.d:0 "Turkey formally announced it will occupy the lands lost by the Ottoman Empire in the First Balkan War. The Turkish government claims the territory will enable many Turks to return to ancestral homes and keep Greece from becoming a threat for the future. The reaction from Greece is expected to be extreme, as many will fear for their family members now under Turkish occupation. Many neighboring states are expressing deep concern over what the future will hold."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.123.d:0 "The embattled Greek government is struggling to maintain order amidst growing unrest. Many Greeks are stunned at the extent of their national defeat and loss of their northern heartland. Greece will be grappling with the separation of so many families due to the new Turkish occupation. International reporters are discussing a palpable mood of depression among the people and it will take time for the country to come together. There are rumors that military officers are traveling in civilian clothes to avoid abuse from the public."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.124.d:0 "Following an emergency meeting, NATO announced it would place economic and military sanctions on our nation. This is an overreaction to our just liberation of lands our people were brutally expelled from. Our military forces achieved an overwhelming victory, and we refuse to waste their historic victory to appease foreign powers. These sanctions mean nothing, we will find new partners and will not be dictated to by the West and their hypocrisy. We do not expect much backlash from our own people who continue to strongly support the nation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.125.d:0 "Following an emergency NATO meeting, the alliance has agreed on providing us with massive military aid. NATO believes it is essential to restore our military credibility to enable us to meet our obligations to the alliance. More importantly, this equipment will allow us to ensure the rapacious Greeks do not attempt to take even more land from us in the future. Indeed, some commanders are suggesting we begin positioning the new equipment to prepare for the future liberation of our lost lands. However, these discussions must be kept private from NATO."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.126.d:0 "Following an emergency NATO meeting, the alliance has agreed on providing us with massive military and economic aid. NATO believes it is essential to restore our military credibility and economy to enable us to meet our obligations with the alliance. More importantly, this support will allow us to ensure the rapacious Turks do not attempt to take even more land from us in the future. The senior leadership will hold meetings in the coming days to ensure this support can be effectively utilized to maximize our capabilities to counter the ongoing Turkish threat."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.127.d:0 "The recent conflict with Turkey and their seizure of our territory highlighted the limitations of our alliance with NATO. NATO had ample opportunity to aid us in our moment of crisis but chose not to. What support we did receive proved ineffective. Many in the country, especially in the media are pointing to NATO as an alliance that demands much but offers little in return. They also question, considering the recent war, that concerns over communism may actually be overblown. Supporters of NATO admit recent actions were disappointing but overall the alliance offers many benefits and protections to Turkey. The cabinet will meet to discuss the future status of Greece within NATO."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.128.d:0 "The recent Greco-Turkish War ended inconclusively. Neither side was able to gain a dominant position over the other. Propaganda in both nations sought to emphasize their military successes and downplay setbacks. Both governments will have to explain why their side did not achieve an overwhelming victory. Indeed, newspapers in both nations are instead focusing on stories of heroism and downplaying the lack of tangible results. Internationally, there is a feeling of relief, as many feared what continued conflict or change of territory would mean for the region long-term." 
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.129.d:0 "Radio Cairo confirmed the United Arab Republic has formally taken control of Hatay from Turkey. There are reports of mass celebrations across the Arab World and UAR troops dancing in the streets with Hatay residents. The UAR invaded Hatay during the recent Greco-Turkish War, taking advantage of the conflict. Their forces managed to occupy the territory and hold it throughout the conflict. The Turkish government confirmed the loss of territory but promised it will never forget the treachery it endured. Although the UAR will bask in its victory, many analysts believe it has gained a permanent enemy in Turkey, adding to its security woes."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.130.d:0 "The United Arab Republic sought to stab us in the back during the recent Greco-Turkish War. They wanted to seize Hatay, on flimsy grounds of Arab unity. Predictably, our forces countered the invasion and pushed deep into their territory. At the end of the conflict we control northern Syria, including the historical city of Aleppo. We are faced with three options, to either return the captured lands, permanently occupy northern Syria, or establish a friendly Syrian government. Returning the territory would repair relations and re-establish the pre-war situation, our victory proved they cannot defeat us. Annexing the lands could give us a buffer to watch the UAR, but risk making them a permanent enemy. Finally, establishing a Syrian government gives us a viable buffer state and can threaten the unity of the United Arab Republic."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.131.d:0 "Turkey announced its forces were vacating those lands it seized from the United Arab Republic during the recent Greco-Turkish War. The Turkish government stated its operations were purely defensive and it held no territorial ambitions. Many analysts believe Turkey did not wish the responsibility of occupying Arab lands and involving itself more deeply in the Middle East. The Turkish military also demonstrated its military superiority over its opponent. The UAR is downplaying the announcement, instead trying to portray the withdrawal as an indication of its military successfully inflicting enough damage to force a Turkish retreat. The arrival of refugees and retreating forces to UAR cities largely limited the effectiveness of this propaganda."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.132.d:0 "The Turkish government confirmed its forces were in control of Aleppo and northern Syria. They did not state if the occupation is meant to be temporary or permanent. A Turkish military spokesman noted the United Arab Republic attempted invasion during the recently concluded Greco-Turkish War meant there was a need to maintain forces to observe UAR intentions. The United Arab Republic condemned the announcement, claiming it will achieve vengeance and liberated all Arabs under the Turkish yoke. Despite its bold statement and aggressive propaganda, many UAR citizens are said to be infuriated with their civilian and military leaders who they blame for the defeat."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.133.d:0 "In a major development, the Turkish military formally handed administration of northern Syria to a newly established Republic of Syria. Many Syrian nationalists, including those fleeing from United Arab Republic territory are flocking to join the new regime. Several nationalists serving with the UAR military are said to have defected as well. Turkey pledged to support the new regime as its leaders called for the liberation of Syria from UAR occupation. Foreign diplomats see the new state as a Turkish buffer and its nationalist propaganda as a potent threat to the Pan-Arab ideology of the UAR. Cairo condemned the development, claiming the new regime is a puppet for Turkish imperialism and those who join it as enemies to the Arab people. There is reports of unrest in Damascus."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.134.d:0 "The recent conflict with Turkey and their seizure of our territory highlighted the limitations of our alliance with NATO. NATO had ample opportunity to aid us in our moment of crisis but chose not to. What support we did receive proved ineffective. Many in the country, especially in the media are pointing to NATO as an alliance that demands much but offers little in return. They also question, considering the recent war, that concerns over communism may actually be overblown. Supporters of NATO admit recent actions were disappointing but overall the alliance offers many benefits and protections to Turkey. The cabinet will meet to discuss the future status of Greece within NATO."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.135.d:0 "The government of Greece announced it will formally withdraw from NATO. Greek leaders then released a statement noting the sense of betrayal felt by all Greeks as the alliance failed to meet its basic obligations. The goals for NATO are no longer compatible with the interests of Greece. Many analysts believe Greece will seek to forge a new, less globally focused foreign policy. It will seek partnerships that enable it to expand its capabilities in case it faces another clash with Turkey. Many Greeks now feel NATO plays favorites and it lacks a true commitment to protecting democracy in Europe."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.136.d:0 "Yugoslavia sought to join the Greek crusade against us and were shattered by our brave soldiers. We occupy their land and can dictate a peace. Many of our top officials agree that if we try to expand territorially or impose too harsh conditions will only add to our enemies. Instead, they propose we impose war indemnities and a demilitarized border. This will help us focus on securing our gains in Greece without a northern threat. However, some argue we should give independence to Macedonia and have that act as a buffer zone. A decision must be made."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.137.d:0 "The Turkish government announced it had reached an agreement on ending hostilities with Yugoslavia. It would withdraw its forces on the condition Yugoslavia demilitarize its border with Turkey and pay war indemnities. The Yugoslavian government quietly confirmed the conditions. Considering its military suffered heavy losses in the conflict, the conditions were not as harsh as some expected. Many experts believe the Turkish government was seeking to minimize the risk of Yugoslavia and Greece growing closer out of a desire for revenge. Turkey appears poised to be the established regional power for the foreseeable future."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.138.d:0 "The Turkish government announced the establishment of the Republic of Macedonia. In a statement it noted the Macedonian people had long clamored for independence from Yugoslavian domination and Turkey provided it. The Yugoslavian government issued a protest but did not go as far as to threaten a military response. Considering the military defeat Yugoslavia has suffered, it will not likely be able to respond for some time. The establishment of Macedonia makes Turkey an established power in the region."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.139.d:0 "The corrupt Albanian regime sought to join Greece against us but were shattered by our brave soldiers. We occupy their land and can dictate a peace. The Turkish and Albanian people have long enjoyed a deep, historical connection. Our forces in Albania report the people are upset and fearful of the government. Our own analysts note the regime is illegitimate and cruel. With our victory over Greece and increased presence in the region, the best decision is to replace the Albanian regime. We will provide the Albanian people our protection and support as they build a new nation. The orders are to be issued soon."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.140.d:0 "In a thrilling overnight operation, Turkish forces, working with Albanian allies deposed the government. A new government announced its establishment in the morning. In a statement, the Turkish government praised the Albanian people for taking back control of their nation. The establishment of a new, pro-Turkish regime in Tirana has greatly strengthened Turkish power in the Balkans. During the recent Greco-Turkish War, Albania suffered a major defeat, and its government could not resist the Turkish-supported takeover. Observers note the Turkish action has helped secured its position in the region."
 
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.141.d:0 "The Enosis Crisis began following the collapse of the internationally agreed upon Cyprus constitution. The new regime has declared Enosis or unification with Greece. The Turkish military on the island has seized the northern part of the island, claiming it is protecting the Turkish Cypriots from oppression. This puts our NATO ally Turkey, in a collision course with the Soviet ally Greece. Senior military officials believe we should tell the Americans we support Turkey and their just cause for protecting the interests of all Cypriots. Other officials feel our own experience showed Cyprus cannot be tamed and is not worth a world war. We must decide our position on this issue and inform the United States."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.142.d:0 "The British ambassador recently met with the President to discuss the Enosis Crisis in Cyprus. He noted the United Kingdom had extensive experience with the island and concluded the Turkish action, though hastily done, was justified. If the communist Greek regime was not challenged, it could encourage similar communist plots in the region and along the border of other NATO states. A failure to back Turkey could also be viewed as not only appeasement but a betrayal of an ally. The ambassador added the United Kingdom would keep its opinion private for the moment and follow our lead on the matter."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.143.d:0 "The British ambassador recently met with the President to discuss the Enosis Crisis in Cyprus. He noted the United Kingdom had extensive experience with the island and concluded the Turkish action was reckless. The United Kingdom recommends our government push Turkey to withdraw and not let them drag NATO into a world war over Cyprus. Although many may view a failure to support Turkey as caving into communist demands, this is not the case. The ambassador added the United Kingdom would keep its opinion private for the moment and follow our lead on the matter."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.144.d:0 "In a kneejerk reaction, Turkish forces have occupied northern Cyprus. This has caused a major international crisis as it puts Turkey, our NATO ally, in a hostile position towards Greece, a Soviet ally. Turkey feels, rightly, that the Greek machinations are behind the collapse of the Cyprus constitution. However, supporting the Turkish action could result in a conflict with the Soviet Union. Such a conflict would be disastrous for Turkey as it would find itself in a two-front war. As a result, there are some officials saying we should threaten Turkey with expulsion from NATO if they do not withdraw. Other officials believe not backing Turkey is appeasement and we should remain committed to our ally. The United Kingdom, who controlled extensive"
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.145.d:0 "The United States recently dispatched a high-powered delegation to Ankara for a day long discussion on Cyprus. Behind closed doors the Americans unequivocally stated they expected us to withdraw from Cyprus and de-escalate the crisis. The Americans say we unilaterally escalated the situation and now the world is at risk of a global war. They added such a conflict would put us in a two-front war, with the Soviets attacking from the east. It is clear if the situation on Cyprus escalates, the United States will expel us from NATO and leave us to face an overwhelming communist invasion. Many in the cabinet are now in favor of a withdrawal, the Americans did say they would back a future agreement regarding the protection of Turkish Cypriots. However, some officials feel the United States is bluffing and politically it cannot allow a major communist victory. We must decide how to proceed."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.146.d:0 "Foreign reporters and Greek forces in Cyprus confirmed the withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Cyprus. The Turkish government has not confirmed the news. Many observers are linking the withdrawal to the recent visit to Ankara by a high-powered delegation from the United States. It appears the United States and NATO were not interested in supporting the Turkish decision to seize the northern part of the island. The Greek government released a statement promising that all citizens on Cyprus, regardless of their identity, would enjoy prosperity and protection under the revolution."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.147.d:0 "Following our warning to Turkey about continuing to escalate the crisis in Cyprus, its government sent a message that it would not withdraw its forces. Turkey claims if its forces withdraw, they will condemn Cypriot Turks to annihilation. It added that Turkey would not seek to capture the island or start an armed conflict but it could not withdraw. We are now left with a difficult choice, we can go through with our promise and call an emergency NATO meeting to expel Turkey. Or we can wait and see how this plays out, perhaps open a dialogue with the Soviets on de-escalating the situation. Abandoning Turkey at this stage could result in a major diplomatic setback and open the door for a communist invasion of Turkey."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.148.d:0 "In a stunning emergency meeting, NATO voted to expel Turkey from the organization. Turkey faced accusations for dangerously pushing the alliance into a global conflict to satisfy its own interests. Turkey was quick to accuse the organization of hypocrisy, noting it was being betrayed by its so-called allies. There are reports of protests in front of NATO member embassies in Ankara. The Turkish government is also said to be demanding an immediate downgrade of NATO diplomatic missions within its borders. The vote proved contentious and there are rumors some NATO members are questioning whether the decision has made the alliance impotent."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.149.d:0 "Through private channels, the Americans have reached out. They are growing increasingly concerned over the ongoing crisis in Cyprus. They feel, as do many of our officials, that it would be disastrous if a conflict with Greece or Turkey turns escalates into a global conflict. The Americans propose we press Greece and Turkey to accept a partition of the island, with a promise to eventually resolve the conflict through bilateral discussions. It is clear discussions in the Western media that the United States will not back Turkey in the conflict is not true. Our diplomats confirmed the Americans will remain committed to Turkey but are looking to de-escalate the crisis."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.150.d:0 "In a surprise move, the United States and Soviet Union released a joint statement claiming the crisis in Cyprus will soon be resolved. Neither the Greek or Turkish government indicated such a plan was in the works, leading to rumors the two major powers came to an agreement without them. Some officials in both nations have privately confirmed they were only informed of the plan hours before its release and pressed into agreeing. The details of the plan call for a partition of Cyprus, with Turkey occupying the Turkish neighborhoods and Greece taking the rest of the island. Greece and Turkey have also agreed to eventually reach a bilateral resolution to permanently settle the issue."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.151.d:0 "Following intense negotiations, brokered by the United States and Soviet Union, the Cyprus Crisis appears to have been resolved. Turkey will take control of northern Cyprus, to oversee the Turkish community on the island. The rest of the island will be controlled by Greece. Both sides agreed to resolve the issue through bilateral discussions. Nationalists in both countries are said to be infuriated, with many believing foreign pressure forced a resolution. Regardless, both nations are reducing their military alert levels. Turkish and Greek forces on the island are establishing a working boundary."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.152.d:0 "During an emergency meeting between government and military leaders, discussions were held on whether to ask the Soviet Union permission to issue an ultimatum against Turkey. The recent decision by NATO to expel Turkey has isolated them. Many of the senior military leaders believe the current situation gives us the potential to achieve a decisive victory. The only drawback is if the Soviets refuse to back us, we will be unable to press for a military resolution in Cyprus. Ultimately the government must decide what action to take."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.153.d:0 "The Greek government wishes our consent in allowing them to issue an ultimatum against Turkey. They want Turkey to withdraw its forces from Cyprus or be forcibly evicted. Greece pointed out that NATO recently evicted Turkey over its actions on Cyprus. They note this may be the best opportunity to take advantage. Many senior officials agree with this assessment, but there are some who feel we should deny the Greek request. Instead, they feel we could use this opportunity to persuade Turkey into close ties with us. Bringing Turkey into our sphere would completely secure our southern front. A refusal could also infuriate the Greek government. A decision must be made soon."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.154.d:0 "The Soviet government has refused our request to place an ultimatum on Turkey for their blatant interference on Cyprus. This is very disappointing news as we felt strongly the situation was heavily in our favor. Our top defense experts fear a failure to act now could give Turkey the time it needs to prepare for any action. The Soviets only stated the moment was not right for any action. Our ambassador in Moscow believes there are several factors effecting the Soviet decision. Some in their government feel a conflict with Turkey could lead to a wider war with the West. There is also a feeling that Turkey could be a potential site of revolutionary activity in the future. Regardless, we must follow their decision and trust it."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.1540.d:0 "The communist regime in Greece recently issued an ultimatum calling for us to withdraw our forces from Cyprus. This would put the local Cypriot Turkish population at risk and alienate our people. However, it is clear the Soviet Union plans on aiding Greece, especially since NATO will not back us and we are isolated internationally. There are grave concerns on how long we can hold off a major communist onslaught. Many senior officials are urging the government to withdraw from Cyprus, avoid war, and wait for a better time to support our brothers on Cyprus. The decision is up to the government on how to proceed."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.155.d:0 "The Turkish government announced it will withdraw its soldiers from Cyprus. It claimed the decision is not due to the Greek ultimatum but because the Turkish government wishes to exhaust all peaceful options first. It appears the likely intervention of the Soviet Union in the event of a conflict pushed the Turkish government to stand down and avoid conflict. Many prominent Cypriot Turks are said to be leaving with the Turkish force, as they fear persecution or detention by the Greek government. Somber rallies were held in solidarity with the Cypriot Turks across the country."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.156.d:0 "At the behest of senior military commanders, the Prime Minister held a closed-door meeting. Afterwards, aids reported the Prime Minister seemed shaken afterwards. The next morning, he called a cabinet meeting and informed the government Turkey would withdraw its forces from Cyprus effective immediately. This is a complete turnaround in policy and will effectively end the Cyprus Crisis in favor of Greece. Rumors are circulating that the generals, fearful of the existential threat posed by the likely Soviet intervention on the side of Greece, threatened to take power from the government unless they reversed course. If the rumors are true, this is truly a dark day for the Cypriot Turks and democracy in Turkey."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.157.d:0 "During an emergency meeting between government and military leaders, discussions were held on whether to ask the Soviet Union permission to issue an ultimatum against Turkey. Many of the senior military leaders believe the current situation gives us the potential to achieve a decisive victory. However, doing so may cause NATO to intervene. Some in the Soviet Union certainly would welcome an opportunity to take on NATO and the United States. The only drawback is if the Soviets refuse to back us, we will be unable to press for a military resolution in Cyprus. Ultimately the government must decide what action to take"
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.158.d:0 "The Greek government wishes our consent in allowing them to issue an ultimatum against Turkey. They want Turkey to withdraw its forces from Cyprus or be forcibly evicted. Greece pointed out that the ultimatum may risk a NATO intervention, but they are prepared to support us all the way. They note this may be the best opportunity to confront the West. Many senior officials agree with this assessment, but there are some who feel we should deny the Greek request. For these officials, risking an all-out conflict with NATO to satisfy Greek territorial demands is not worth the risks. A decision must be made soon."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.159.d:0 "The communist regime in Greece recently issued an ultimatum against Turkey. They are calling for Turkey to withdraw from Cyprus or be forcibly evicted. Turkey is a NATO ally and we are obligated to defend them according to collective defense. However, such a conflict will likely escalate to include the Soviet Union. We recently held an emergency National Security Council Meeting. Some of the military leaders believe we should stand firmly with Turkey and stand up to the communist threat in eastern Europe. Other officials voiced grave concerns over such a conflict. They instead suggest we reach out to the Soviet Union and press for a peaceful resolution. A decision must be made."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.160.d:0 "Following failed negotiations and the expiration of an ultimatum by Greece, Turkish and Greek forces are said to be fighting on Cyprus and along their international border. Greece, a Warsaw Pact member, and Turkey, a member of NATO, have also brought their respective alliances into the conflict. The Soviet Union issued a statement saying its forces would intervene for the sake of international peace. The United States declared it would bring its full support to protect the people of Turkey from the threat of international communism. News of the fighting is sending shockwaves across the globe as there are concerns about what further escalation in the conflict would mean."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.161.d:0 "Our forces and brave allies achieved an overwhelming victory over NATO in Turkey. The enemies of the proletariat were justly overwhelmed. Once again, we demonstrated that imperialist pawns cannot halt the will of the people. The Greek government wishes to seize large swaths of Turkey, to restore the historical territory of Greece. Our own officials believe we should take eastern Turkey, including Kars to ensure our southern flank is secure. However, there are those who feel such territorial demands may only cause long-term problems and opportunities for our enemies to exploit in the future. They instead propose more modest territorial claims to permanently weaken Turkey and avoid future problems. We must decide what approach to take."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.162.d:0 "The Soviet Union and its allies revealed they wish to make extensive territorial claims on Turkey. The Soviets and Greeks are seeking to implement the territorial claims Greece made on Turkey after World War I. In addition, the Soviets want to take Kars and surrounding territory to act as a buffer. Considering the present military situation, there is little we can do to stop this loss of territory. The biggest concern is how Turkey will react. This setback may cause them to re-evaluate their relationship with NATO, unless we can offer support. Major newspapers are heaping criticism on our effort in the recent conflict."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.163.d:0 "The Soviet Union and its allies revealed they wish to make extensive territorial claims on Turkey. It appears the Soviets and Greece are seeking to limit their territorial claims to Edrine, Istanbul, and Kars. The loss of such territory will weaken Turkey and provide the Soviets a buffer. The biggest concern is how Turkey will react. This setback may cause them to re-evaluate their relationship with NATO, unless we can offer support. Major newspapers are heaping criticism on our effort in the recent conflict."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.164.d:0 "Our nation suffered a massive defeat in the recent conflict with the Warsaw Pact. Our NATO alliance did not offer the protection and support we expected. Many in the country are bitterly disappointed and fear the territorial demands will cripple our nation and divide the Turkish people. There are some officials who believe we should approach the Soviets ourselves. We can offer some territorial concessions, such as giving up Cyprus and cede Kars to the Soviets to satisfy their security concerns. More importantly, we will also pledge to withdraw from NATO and maintain neutrality. This will assuage Soviet concerns and greatly weaken NATO. However, there are officials who feel this proposal, though saving territory, would leave us exposed for future aggression."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.165.d:0 "The Turkish government recently sent a private peace proposal for us. They are no doubt fearful of the lands they will lose in any peace proposal due to their foolish association with NATO. The Turkish proposal offers eastern territory to us and permanently cedes Cyprus to Greece. More intriguingly, Turkey promises to withdraw from NATO and maintain strict neutrality. Many of our officials feel this proposal could remove NATO as a threat from the Eastern Mediterranean and strike a major blow to the United States. However, there are others in the government who feel we achieved such a major victory that we should not miss this opportunity to spread our influence."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.166.d:0 "In a shocking development, the Soviet Union announced it had reached an agreement with Turkey to end the NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict over Cyprus. Turkey agreed to completely give up any territory or claims to Cyprus. It also will allow a Soviet occupation of Kars and its surrounding areas to ensure peace. More significantly, Turkey will withdraw from NATO, cancel any agreements with the alliance, and maintain strict neutrality. The United States expressed its disappointment with the news while the Turkish government is being praised by many Turks for saving millions of its citizens from falling under foreign occupation. However, many observers note Turkey may have only delayed future aggression."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.167.d:0 "Athens and Moscow confirmed the Warsaw Pact will take over extensive Turkish territories. The Greek government noted it has restored the historical lands of Greece, including Constantinople. The Soviets are said to be establishing a garrison in Kars, where its forces are establishing a buffer zone in eastern Turkey. Considering the extent of the Turkish and NATO defeat during the conflict, its diplomats have only issued protests against the communist expansion. The Turkish government has so far refused to comment on the situation, though sources in Ankara indicate there is a genuine feeling of despair among political and military leaders. Despite the territorial gains, some analysts warn both Greece and the Soviet Union must find a way to administer a significant Turkish population resistant to their rule."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.168.d:0 "The Soviet Union, speaking for its Warsaw Pact allies, announced its ally Greece will take over all European lands held by Turkey, including Constantinople. It also confirmed its forces would occupy a buffer zone in eastern Turkey, centered around Kars. The loss of Istanbul and Kars will leave Turkey economically, culturally, and geographically weakened but the lost territory is not as significant as some thought. Experts suggests the Soviets do not believe Greece can absorb all the territories it had demanded. The Greek government announced a national holiday to celebrate the victory of its revolution over imperialists. The Turkish government in Ankara is said to be preparing for the influx of refugees."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.169.d:0 "The recent conflict with Greece and its communist allies ended up being a disaster. Our NATO allies failed to adequately support us in the field, resulting in the military defeat. Now millions of Turks are under communist rule and our nation stands at its most vulnerable place. At the Grand National Assembly, a growing faction of political leaders are clamoring for us to withdraw from NATO. They feel the alliance failed and a new round of fighting could result in the end of the republic. Perhaps they are right, and we should leave the alliance and forge a new path. Many senior security officials oppose this, noting without NATO protection, the communists may just finish the job. Instead, they say we must reach out to the United States first and ask for support. If the Americans refuse to help us rebuild, then there will be no choice but to leave NATO."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.170.d:0 "Turkey has officially withdrew from the NATO alliance,as its leaders cited the need for Turkey to rebuild itself and its inability to meet economic or military obligations for the alliance. Within Turkey the news is being met with widespread support as many Turks blame the alliance for betraying Turkey and not providing enough support during its recent conflict with communist Greece and its allies. NATO released its own statement expressing disappointment at the decision. In a terse follow up statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced its expectation that all NATO personnel should withdraw from the nation immediately and that it will review the level of NATO diplomatic missions in the country."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.171.d:0 "We received word from our embassy in Ankara that the Turkish government seeks a major aid package from us. Turkey suffered heavily in the recent NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict and many in Turkey blame the United States for not preventing their defeat. The embassy officials believe Turkey is not publicly asking for this aid, as this would enflame anti-US sentiment. Instead they feel an American offer would calm tensions and restore faith in NATO. A refusal to offer major support likely will lead to Turkey leaving NATO. There are a lot of advisors who support offering an aid package, however, there are some who believe the present situation of Turkey makes it a liability, and letting it leave NATO may be in our interest."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.172.d:0 "The United States announced it will offer a massive aid package to help rebuild the Turkish military and economy. The American government said its support is meant to provide a helping hand to a valuable friend of the United States. The announcement was welcomed by Turkey. The recent anti-NATO campaign within the Turkish parliament has largely lost momentum following news of the aid package. A more defiant Turkish government released another statement claiming it will never forget its people now behind the iron curtain. The Soviet Union criticized the United States for trying to militarize the region further."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.173.d:0 "NATO and Warsaw Pact forces halted fighting over the Greco-Turkish Crisis over Cyprus. Neither side was able to decisively defeat the other, although some territory was exchanged. From Geneva, representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union announced an agreement to withdraw forces to pre-war boundaries. Both sides will be disappointed at the result. The Soviet government released a statement claiming the fighting was a success as imperialist efforts to dismantle the revolution utterly failed. The United States noted NATO stood firmly behind its ally and prevented a communist push to forcibly destroy democracy in Turkey."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.174.d:0 "With the help of our NATO allies we not only stopped the communist aggression against Turkey but also captured huge swaths of Greek territory. The Turkish government is quite adamant they want to control northern Greece and its islands to firmly cut off Greece from its communist allies. Our experts worry that Turkey may have a hard time controlling that much territory, which could interfere with its NATO obligations. Instead, there is an alternative proposal to have Turkey occupy Rhodes, Kavala, including its surrounding areas, and Cyprus. These are more manageable and would greatly weaken the strategic position of Greece in a future conflict. A proposal to turn northern Greece into an anti-communist Greek regime is currently not seen as viable to the Turkish authorities."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.175.d:0 "The imperialists did not surprise anyone by unveiling their nefarious plot to dismantle our revolutionary ally Greece. NATO announced it planned on occupying northern Greece and other strategic lands to ‘ensure peace in the region’. In reality, they are cutting Greece off from us and strengthening their strategic position in the region. The people of Greece and the whole world will be distraught by the news, however, we are unfortunately incapable of changing the situation due to the military situation on the ground. Despite this setback, we will not forget this humiliation."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.176.d:0 "The imperialists did not surprise anyone by unveiling their nefarious plot to neuter our revolutionary ally Greece. NATO will hand Cyprus, Rhodes, and Kavala to Turkish military occupation. They claim this is to ensure continued peace in the region, but it is clearly a move meant to weaken the strategic position of Greece and enable a future invasion. The international community will no doubt see the true nature behind this decision. Due to the military situation, our options are limited to just declaring our opposition to the proposal."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.177.d:0 "News from an emergency NATO meeting in Ankara confirmed that Turkey will be the occupying authority in the islands and northern provinces of Greece captured during the war. NATO insists the occupation is not territorial expansion, but simply a way to ensure there are no further conflicts in the region. The Soviet Union and Greek government quickly condemned the decision as punitive and designed to inflict the maximum punishment on the people of Greece. Analysts note holding this much territory may be a challenge for Turkey, but it does essentially cut Greece off from the Balkans and the Soviet Union."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.178.d:0 "News from an emergency NATO meeting in Ankara confirmed that Turkey will be the occupying authority for Rhodes, Cyprus, and Kavala. The alliance claims it is only occupying those strategic locations to prevent further communist aggression from Greece and defend its interests. The decision brings an end to the recent NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict over Cyprus, which ended in a major victory for Turkey and its NATO allies. Greece and the Soviet Union condemned the occupation as a preamble for renewed conflict in the future."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.179.d:0 "The recent conflict with NATO ended in a disaster. We now find Greek workers under foreign occupation and our economy in turmoil. The military also needs to rebuild its capabilities as we would be foolish to assume the capitalists will not strike again. There is an increasing anti-Soviet sentiment, even within the party, but we are doing our best to suppress them. Considering our situation, we will dispatch a high-level delegation to ask our Soviet comrades for help in this most difficult time."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.180.d:0 "A high-level delegation arrived in Moscow to ask our help in providing them economic and military aid. The Greeks warn us a failure to back the regime may empower counterrevolutionaries and open a space for them. This is a compelling case, and our own analysts confirm these fears are well-founded. There are even reports of capitalist agents fanning the flames of discontent. As such, there is strong support to offer Greece aid. However, another faction in the government notes we also suffered heavily in the recent conflict. Perhaps we should explain to Greece that a strong Soviet Union is for the ultimate benefit of all socialist states."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.181.d:0 "Our delegation in Moscow signed a comprehensive military and economic aid package. This will greatly boost our capabilities and rebuilding efforts. It will also restore morale among the people and in the party. Unlike the past, when we allied with the capitalists, our socialist friends will not abandon the Greek people. Turkey and the United States condemned the agreement as an unnecessary military buildup. However, they must realize that regardless of the situation, the party and state will never abandon its duty to liberate all Greeks from oppression."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.182.d:0 "The United Arab Republic (UAR) has launched an invasion of Turkey, hoping to seize the Arab populated Turkish province of Hatay. They are claiming to be fighting to liberate the land and support Greece, which shares its non-aligned view, but this is utter nonsense. It is an act of aggression and a dress rehearsal to their plans for invading Israel. A successful UAR invasion could significantly strengthen this hositle regime. This is unacceptable, we must do something to weaken the UAR war effort. One option is to order a mobilization and deployment of military personnel on the UAR border. The UAR will no doubt be forced to keep troops on our border, weakening their ability to deploy reserves against Turkey. The other option is to commence the mobilization and then launch our own attack in a week. We should target Syria and its coastline to cutoff UAR forces invading Turkey."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.183.d:0 "The ongoing Greco-Turkish War has escalated again as Israeli forces are said to be launching operations against the United Arab Republic (UAR). The UAR recently declared war on Turkey, citing its support of Greece and in capturing the Turkish province of Hatay. The Israeli government claimed it had to act to save its nation from an increasingly aggressive, anti-Israeli regime in Cairo. Analysts believe the Israelis will likely target the Syrian territories of the UAR to isolate and cutoff the flow of supplies to the UAR forces engaged against Turkey."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.184.d:0 "The invasion of Hatay by the United Arab Republic saw a major escalation in the Greco-Turkish War over Cyprus. Within days, Israel joined the conflict on the side of Turkey, trying to stop what it saw was UAR aggression. This conflict ended in a major defeat for the UAR as its forces were defeated in Syria. Following high level talks between Israeli and Turkish officials in Damascus, Israel agreed to withdraw its forces, while Turkey oversaw the transition of power to a new Syrian government. Both sides agreed on the need to remove the UAR regime in Syria. The Turkish government praised the decision, stating Turks will be proud their people helped liberate Syria from the boot of Cairo. The UAR strongly condemned the decision, but are in no position to prevent it."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.185.d:0 "With the Greco-Turkish War wrapping up, the fighting in the middle east has similarly come to an end. Neither the United Arab Republic or Israel managed to achieve a victory. The fighting proved inconclusive and both sides agreed to a return of pre-war borders. Both sides are claiming victory. Israel notes its forces succeeded in tying up large numbers of UAR forces from its conflict with Turkey. The UAR claims its forces repelled all Israeli attacks and destroyed huge amounts of their equipment. Despite the large boasts, neither side will gain any new territory." 
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.186.d:0 "Following a ceasefire between the United Arab Republic (UAR) and Israel, the UAR confirmed it is in control of Haifa and its surrounding areas. The Israeli government has condemned the UAR for its naked aggression. The fighting had started when Israel attacked the UAR for its invasion of Turkey. In the ensuing conflict, the UAR forces managed to push Israeli forces back. There is expected to be a great deal of backlash among Israelis as many citizens are now under the occupation of an Arab state."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.187.d:0 "There are massive protests being held across Israel by enraged citizens who feel Haifa and its people were abandoned to the United Arab Republic (UAR). Many Israelis believe the civil and military leadership failed the people and soldiers with their poor decision making. The government is also being accused of rushing into a conflict without preparations or a clear objective. One bitter protester asked if Haifa was worth helping the Turks. The Israeli government and military already announced a full inquiry and investigation will be conducted to understand what occurred and how to prevent it in the future."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.188.d:0 "Our brave armed forces successfully liberated northern Palestine from the Zionists. We blunted their efforts at expanding their occupation and managed to take back some lands. Now the decision must be made on what to do next. The UAR is for all Arabs, so naturally many believe these lands should be integrated with the state. However, such a move could provoke unnecessary criticism by other Arab states who will argue we are annexing land. Another solution is to establish a Palestinian administration, that eventually can join the UAR once firmly in place."
 THIRD_BALKAN_WAR.189.d:0 "Arabs across the world are cheering the United Arab Republic for their victory over the Zionists. Despite being the victim of an unprovoked attack, the valiant Arab armies proved victorious. The Egyptians are currently in control of northern Palestine and their are calls for Arabs expelled to return home. Many were moved to tears when the UAR released images of its soldiers rebuilding a village where its Arab residents were expelled during the Nakba. Despite the victory, the future status of these lands is of great interest across many Arab capitals."
